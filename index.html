I was really appreciative of the list of the top effective ways of reducing carbon emission/ greenhouse gas. It is way more useful to focus on changes in your life, like plant-based diet, that are more impactful than just any change, switch to LED lights. I was really overwhelmed by the amount of data and statistical information provided for each solution. As interesting as it is, I was bombarded with a lot of projections. A quick summary of each solution really assisted in having a better picture and image of these ideas, especially for the agricultural solutions (Conservation agriculture, tree intercropping, etc.).
<br><br>
I find it really interesting that globally reducing food waste could have 10xs the effect of switching to LED lights because growing up I always heard and saw advertisements for switching light bulbs to save the planet. The fact that the press and media are advertising solutions that aren’t even the most impactful truly shows the audacity of marketers to take advantage of every situation. Advertisements for plant-based diets are not that common because most companies won’t really benefit from it. It truly reveals to us that we can not just rely on the media and advertisements to tell us how to solve and face these issues. They will only guide society towards what profits them alone. We need to turn to science and people who have the interest of the planet in mind rather than money. I do find hope in tv shows about tiny houses and the fact that veganism/ zero waste is becoming a trend because it shows that social media and television can be used for good and for educational purposes rather than only greed and vanity. Instagram and youtube are how I started getting into and understanding the climate crisis and these platforms hold so much potential to kickstart a revolution of fighting for our planet.

I was also very glad that a site listed out all the things that are contributing to our CO2 emissions and the impact it is having on our planet and what alternatives we can use more of to bring our emissions down. Along with you, I was a bit overwhelmed by all of the data they provided because a lot of it went over my head. However, I think it is a good thing to provide all this data as it shows credibility and i'm sure a lot of people after seeing the data will appreciate all the alternative solutions to reduce CO2 emissions. I also think that providing all of these things that we can do to help our emissions is a very persuasive and informative tactic to get people to cut their carbon footprint as much as possible. A lot of these sections were very interesting to me as it shows how big companies don’t do their part in reducing their carbon footprint because it will reduce their earnings. I think we need to be more informed on what is being emitted into the atmosphere and the alternative solutions that can help cut that number down.


<br><hr>
I am also very appreciative of this list, and knowing that there are 100 (and even more) ways that we can save our planet is very hopeful, especially compared to all the readings we had in the first half of the quarter. I’ve been wanting solutions from day 1 and we’ve talked about them for a few days, but now we are really getting into the change we have to make, and how. 
<br><br>

Unlike you I didn’t really feel overwhelmed by the statistics, and I’m not the biggest fan of numbers like people I know, but I actually enjoyed seeing the facts because it added great value to the arguments and points project drawdown is saying. I think the numbers helped people know that Project Drawdown is serious and their projections are factual; making their solutions more viable. Although this reading took longer than I had thought it would, it was very interesting and each point was very thorough in a small amount of words.
<br><br>

I also think it’s crazy that the media isn’t hyping up refrigerant management at all even though it is the number one change we can make, as containing 87% of refrigerants would avoid 89.7 gigatons of CO2 emissions. Luckily, plant based food is becoming popular, even in fast food joints like Carl’s Jr. and Burger King. Companies are all about profits, but as you said veganism is becoming a large trend so these companies are catering to people with plant-based diets so they could gain more customers. I agree social media is very powerful, it has been through this entire process and it can continue to help save the planet.
<br><hr>
I really enjoyed your perspective after reading the “Summary of Solutions”. I was also a bit overwhelmed with all of the data and numbers from each solution when I was reading, but when I really processed how significant these numbers really are, I had a better understanding on how important these solutions can be. Looking at each solution's total carbon dioxide reduction, it does not really look like much but when you put all of them together, it really adds up. I really enjoyed this reading, because like you said, it “assisted in having a better picture and image of these ideas” in my head. With all of the other readings I feel as if there is way too much information concentrated in one article that us readers have to process, but with this one I felt like it was very straightforward and just gave me a better understanding of exactly what we need to do. 
<br><br>

I never thought of how the media is actually getting better with presenting solutions to these issues until you brought it up. With this class, we can sometimes get overwhelmed with all of the negative outlooks on society and the media and that everything is just going downhill, but you brought up great examples that counteract that idea. Being reminded that shows about tiny homes, being vegan, etc. are still out there make me want to go watch them right now. Thank you for the reminder because I love those shows!
<br><hr>

I completely agree, it is so much more useful and easier to focus on changes you can make in your everyday life. I have been struggling when learning new information in this class because the issue of climate change seems hopeless and overwhelming. Reading this gave me new ideas on how I can personally make a difference. I was shocked to learn how our current agriculture practices are so disruptive to the environment. Little changes in farming could completely change our soil, crop productivity, we how much carbon we sequester. While reading these ideas I was a little disappointed, as I realized how expensive these solutions are. Implementing them are normally very expensive, so it is hard to visualize them realistically becoming popular. I think beginning to implement them in wealthy countries first, is a good start. 
 <br><br>

I also was surprised at what the media advertises. I realized that companies only advertise what makes them earn money, causing them to be more likely to sell LED light bulbs before campaigning for the right for girls to get an education. As a society, we need to stand up for what is right, regardless of how much profit it makes us. Choices such as wasting less, switching to a plant-based diet, and voting for leaders who support education, all make a difference. I believe all of these ideas can be implemented, especially if the government helps out. With regulations, subsidies, and leaders who believe in change, we can lower greenhouse gas emissions.

<br><hr>
I was really appreciative of this list too Claire. I think it did really help to actually have a concrete list of what we can do to help our planet. However, as I was reading your comment, I began to disagree with your feelings on how we go about using this information. You talk about your discontent with how companies and marketers are abusing the climate for financial gain, although I don't think this fact is all that bad in the big picture.  Sadly, "people who have the interest of the planet in mind rather than money" are not in the majority on a global scale. Merely these people's drive to save the planet will not be sufficient. I think we need to embrace the economics of the climate crisis to get more of the population on board, as frankly, many people will not be in support of progress otherwise. Many conservative leaning individuals, oil companies, and persistent contributors to climate change refute the climate crisis due to the financial losses that many solutions will accrue. But if we advertise possible profit that can be gained from helping the environment, I think that is our best route in gaining more support for our planet. Solutions like the implementation of on-shore wind turbines, solar farms, geothermal energy, and regenerative agriculture will all provide profits in the trillions to the global economy. So why not let people who are merely interested in money invest in these both environmentally beneficial and financially profitable industries?

<br><hr>
I also found the projected benefits of food waste reductions to be one of the most interesting segments of Project Drawdown. Although I didn't think to compare this list to what we are advertised, when you point it out, I too am quite disappointed. Realizing over and over again that everything we've grown up around has been a form of advertisement, and that in many instances it was geared primarily towards profiting corporations is rather dizzying. It feels a bit like so much of what we experience is a lie, and I'm not sure how to even distinguish the lies from truths going forward.
 <br><br>

On a separate note, the two things that jumped out at me about Project Drawdown's list were like we mentioned, food, as well as the number one solution: refrigerant management. Who's ever heard of refrigerant management? I certainly haven't! & Yet it's the number one suggested solution to reducing global emissions. I had no idea that such an unassuming and everyday part of our lives was secretly having such negative impacts. I know families that have 2, 3 plus fridges in their home alone instead of just the necessary one. In Santa Catalina alone, I can't imagine how many fridges are contained in the thousands of rooms, many of which probably won't be kept or used until the end of their lives. On the food front, I couldn't believe that changes to the way we produce, consume, and distribute food compiled over half the top 25 solutions if you include those related to land usage. Golly gee! Head spinning!


<br><hr>
I can't believe the audacity of advertisers to not include some of the top methods to reduce carbon emissions in their messages to the public! When the environmentalist movement started to reach me and my family when I was little, it detailed the importance of recycling and changing to an energy-saving lightbulb. Advertisements I saw on TV never listed the importance of eating a more plant-based diet, and instead drilled in the importance of eating meat with your meals, with a plethora of commercials saying how dairy is crucial to healthy development. I'm extremely angry that I was led astray for years, believing I was doing "all I could" to help the environment when the biggest help would have been to look at the food in front of me. I now realize that the meat/dairy industry has a strong influence over advertisers, and can often stifle opposing opinions.


As far as social media, I really do believe the way we communicate and spread information will be crucial to saving the environment. I LOVE that it has become trendy to use reusable water bottles, thrift, and eat cleanly. I think it is a wonderful next step in changing the way we culturally view our lives and our consumption. And on top of that, it is easier, now more than ever, to mobilize and reach people across the globe. We have seen it with things like the Women's March, how groups across the globe rallied together for a common message. And while I do see this action in the environmental movement, I believe it can be amplified a lot more. The power to reach others across the world is not lost on me, and the impact that the teens/young adults can have on consumer culture isn't a fluke. I mean, the whole hydroflask/scrunchie/sksksksks trend hasn't died out! And thrifting is only becoming more and more popular. 


I do really like this reading though, with all of the short, concise summaries about how and WHY we should do these things, are incredibly helpful. The net projections of savings, as well, stands to turn the tides on any opponents to green living. I just wish everyone would read it.
<br><hr>
I agree with your idea on the list of solutions. Having such a list of solutions is really good for we normal people. With this, we can easily learn something more about what should we do to help to protect the environment. Based on the lecture video of our professor, I was surprised by the fact that the first three of the list of solutions plays a really important part which may be more important than all the other combine. Among the three of them food waste seems to be the most practical one for us because we cannot life without fridge and we cannot really do something to help the development of wind turbines. However, what we can do is that we can reduce the waste of food, and try to change to a plant asked diet if possible. This can also make a big difference. 
 <br><br>

 I think we should start from our our daily life to do these things we can to protect the environment. I believe through all those small steps we made we can finally make a big progress in  the process of saving the climate crisis



<br><hr>
I think you are 100% right. It is truly shocking how much we rely on media platforms to tell us what to do. But why do we only rarely see important things advertised? I find it interesting that you recall a time where you sat and watched a commercial for LED light bulbs and this is when you knew they were good for the environment. I think this is really crucial to note that it impacted you as a child and spurred knowledge. Instead of promoting e-cigs to kids, we should promote environmentally concious messages, using this platform to express our environmental options - educating people. As Ken has said before, education is the most important thing we can do for our society. 
 <br><br>

One of the projects that spoke to me the most was the reduced food waste project. I think it is incredibly sad that so much food gets wasted simply becuase it has a few blemishes on it. Yet this is something I frequently see people doing, and even occasionally think myself when purchasing food in the store. But why has this become normalized? Since when was nature supposed to be blemish free and perfect every single time? We have normalized our fruit being perfectly ripe exactly when we want it to be with no dark spots on it. But with the extreme consumerism that we face today, we don’t have the option to be picky. I think that we need to again, educate people on how much food we waste and just how much it affects the environment.



<br><hr>
I too was very surprised after having seen what the most important changes are. What you said about lightbulbs is so true, in fact, my parent even bought LEDs for the entire house based off the illusion painted by marketers. I was also very surprised to see that refrigerants are what gold the no.1 spot. It really shows the footprint that is made by the wealthy because I personally know a lot of people that don’t have a working A/C in their homes. For me, switching to a more plant-based diet would have to be the most difficult lifestyle change, and prior to having taken this course is something that I would have never even consider to-do. Although I have accepted that this is something that is imperative for me to phase into my lifestyle.
    <br><br>
         I was also taken back by how the technological innovations in the top 25 are actually saving money. Our world can be so much more advanced yet we are stuck in age old methods like burning coal for fossil fuel. Burning coal just sounds ancient to me, how has so many other things advanced but we are still using the same sources of energy from the 1880s, it’s ridiculous.



<br><hr>
I also enjoy reading the list of solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emission which are far more feasible and achievable. As you have mentioned, the statistics is overwhelming and adds credibility for its usefulness. The data speaks for itself. These solutions cover diverse impacts like materials, food and education. I was also surprised to find out that refrigerant management was ranked number one in terms of reducing energy. Initially I thought it may be developing renewable energy and high technology to save energy since I was exposed to these tactics via social media and also in promotion. I share the same feeling with you that social media, or the corporations behind them, target at profitability and they will hide some facts that may harm their profit-making intent. Regarding the point of reducing population suggested by Ken, I consider it to be urgent and critical. Coming from one of the most populated country, I know how the wealth gap is developed in which some people are used to luxury lifestyle while some people are struggling making a living. Thus I really appreciate the solutions in Project Drawdown relating to education in female. Empowering in women will surly protect women and provide them with rights, care and equality.



<br><hr>
I think you are spot on about the fact that the most impactful solutions are not the ones that are most talked about, especially in mainstream political discourse and media. We are constantly told about the little ways in which we can make a difference, most of which are via "smart" or "green" consumption. They tell us to buy electric cars, sustainably produced food, eco-friendly electronics, etc. And yet, none of this "smart" consumption directly addresses the problems that have caused this environmental catastrophe to begin with. It is all part of a deliberate attempt to keep us to consume and perpetuate the free-market system which favors corporate profits over social justice and the natural environment. It's good to see a list of large-scale changes and technologies that could really reduce our collective carbon output, such as reducing food waste, educating girls, and transitioning to renewable energy. However, even this list does not identify the #1 solution to addressing the crisis - deconstructing the petrocapitalist world economy. For even if we are able to accomplish a significant amount of these sustainable goals, it will not matter if fossil fuel corporations are allowed to continue burning all of their carbon assets. The only real comprehensive solution is to restrict these companies from digging up more oil and burning it into our atmosphere. However, these goals are a very important step to transitioning our society to be ready for a fossil-fuel-free world.



<br><hr>
I think the thought that we should trust science is spot on. Real science has no motivation (unless you are backed by fossil fuel companies), but advertisement is all about getting paid. People will pay large amounts of money to push their agenda. This is clear when Ken mentioned how reforming our relationship with food and land use can be 10 time more useful than replacing our light bulbs to LED's. I would like to see who payed for those commercials for I have my own suspicions. Other than that the list was very enlightening. I appreciate the impacts area where it showed not only how much carbon this could save, but how much money it could save. For example in the case of solar, electric companies might even pay you to have solar panel, and they are extremely cost efficient and last fro years. According to Project Drawdown, they would even have a negative cost, yes people would get paid. Those breakdowns make a lot of these solutions not only seem necessary, but generally cost efficient and in the long run beneficial.


<br><hr>


I completely agree with your comment about how the list is a good way to make the readers and audience FOCUS on what changes they can make and what makes the most difference. It reminded me of the beginning of the documentary, "Conspiracy" when the lead Kip was explaining how he made all these changes like taking shorter showers and biking instead of driving, but he found out that after all that time, wasting less food and plant-based diets are much more impactful in mitigating climate change.
    <br><br>
I think one of the biggest reasons why people don't know it because of media skewing the facts. Media has a huge role in almost every American's day to day life and what they see online or on TV translates into their routine. When I think of what I hear about in the media regarding environmental changes I think of companies advertisements for LED light bulbs or solar panels, or TV commercials for electric cars. I rarely ever see campaigns for reducing food waste or eating less red meat and dairy. 
    <br><br>
While exploring, "Project Drawdown" I wanted to learn more about how food waste contributes to environmental degradation and I was disgusted. Just by reading the blurb for the photo on the page, I was so sad to read about how much food we waste by the process of sorting through food for quality assurance purely based on physical appearances. I have heard of a few companies that take there's misshapen or ugly produce and ship them to your house similar to 'Blue Apron' or 'Hello Fresh', and I love the idea behind that because it reduces the waste of perfectly good food and normalizes imperfect produce.



<br><hr>
While I do agree that it is definitely more beneficial to be applying the most impactful changes to our lives, I also believe that doing the little things are definitely important as well. Even though it has been quite some time since we have known about the climate crisis and realized we need to apply changes, in the long run it is just the beginning. It is hard for everyone to just drastically change their lives in order to make a change. Many big things start with small steps, and although it may be easy for some to make huge changes in their lives, for some it is much more difficult, especially for those who do not really understand how much the world is dying. I think that even little steps, such as changing the type of lightbulbs, can make a difference in people’s lives, by allowing them to begin to integrate more environmentally friendly practices in their lives, and ultimately making the big changes. These little things, although making a smaller impact, could eventually lead to big changes and I think they are just as important in this battle against climate change. 
    <br><br>


To address the part about advertisement and marketers, yes these folks have a mindset to only benefit what will make them money, and they are only advertising things small things that are appealing to the general public; however as people start making the small changes that they are advertising, they can start building more knowledge about other things they could be doing, and it can change their mindset to think bigger. When people start thinking bigger and better ways that they can help positively impact the Earth, it will force marketers to change their ways to please these newly environmental thinking people. It is a process and it may take longer than we hope, but it is still something that could help (especially those who are more unaware). All the small things count!



<br><hr>
I totally agree with what you have said and I think that this list was a relatively simple read for such a complex issue. I think that these solutions with their quick summaries would appeal to a larger audience, because people like the simple facts given to them quick. I think that this reading did a good job of that, while like you said also giving data and statistical information. I can also relate to the advertisements you saw as a kid as I am sure us and many of our peers were exposed to the same ones. I find it so interesting how companies have turned to some sort of greenwashing in order to profit while making the consumer feel better about their purchases. Yes, switching to LED lights is better for the environment, but overall there are other simple choices you can make in life that would have a much more significant impact. 
    <br><br>

One of the solutions that I found very interesting and also something that I am passionate was educating girls. I have learned how this can help mitigate climate change in other environmental studies courses and I think it is a solution that can and should be implemented everywhere. Another solution that somewhat coincides with this solution is family planning. Not only will both of these solutions benefit the individuals but also the overall global population. I found it very helpful that not only did the educating girls solution explain how it would help reduce climate change, but also listed what would need to change in order to make this doable.



<br><hr>
I was also immensely relieved by the top 4 ranked solutions to cut down greenhouse gas emission, because we can accomplish these things in our daily life. Stop wasting food, eat more veggies, and limit the use of air conditioning. It is pretty shocking that what we do in our daily life has more impact on global warming than the industries. I used to believe it’s fossil fuel interests’ responsibility to clean up the atmosphere. But after seeing those possible solutions in the reading, I am afraid that they might use this data as an excuse for not doing since the top solutions are not directly related to gasoline. The troublesome fact is that we need to adjust our lifestyle while these pro-gasoline interests could get away with it. I know this might sound a bit aggressive but they have always been the champion of emitting greenhouse gas. And I just feel it is very unfair that the top solutions do not include things like carbon tax or more regulation on these businesses.



<br><hr>
I was under the impression that we were doing so much more when we changed to the LED light bulbs because as you stated, that’s how those advertisements made it out to be. Sadly, that’s not the case but after reading these short paragraphs that ken shared with us, we now know the truth and have found even better and more effective ways to reduce the amount of carbon emissions. I too felt kind of overwhelmed with the amount of numbers thrown at me and didn’t exactly know how to process it all at once. But besides that, the summaries were really helpful compared to the information that came from the impact section.  
    <br><br>

Once I started taking this class, is when I started watching YouTube videos about minimalists and people’s vegan diet, that is where I got more information from and I saw that they got a ton of likes and view. So maybe YouTube is a good way to spread the word about how we can change our live styles for the better of our planet.




<br><hr>
I totally agree with this comment. Common advertisements that use an environmental message often don’t talk about the things that would actually reduce our climate impact. I think honestly it’s just almost impossible to sell a product that has a positive or at least neutral environmental impact because that isn’t compatible with consumption and selling mass commodities. At this point, we pretty much know the current big corporations (and the politicians they control) aren’t going to do anything, so we have to start using our people power to organize against them and start changing ourselves. Constituent organizations, like the Sierra Club or Sunrise, CALPIRG, etc. are the ones who can make legislative change happen. And while they work on that, we need to vote for politicians who will support them and care about constituents more than industry. In addition, we can work on our consumer culture and go vegan today, move to small apartments in places where we don’t need a car in the future (and I would say Isla Vista is such a place).
    <br><br>

I also really agree with the power of social media for culture shifts. Our generation gets a lot of our information through social media, and we can see the firsthand accounts of people who are being impacted by the climate crisis the most. It’s also a really good way to organize people and inspire people to make changes. Influencers have a lot of power, and we can already see a lot of them going vegan for health reasons. If influencers started also giving a more environmental message, they could change a lot of people, especially the youngest, more impressionable generations.



<br><hr>
Yes Exactly! I am so happy that Project Drawdown actually gives us a comprehensive breakdown of how climate change can be addressed. I was very pleased with how they presented the solutions in a list like format ranked in terms of effectiveness. I was also happy that the articles explaining each solution were not too long because lengthy explanations are often mulled over because of they fail to retain the attention of the readers. I was surprised to see that Refrigerant management was labeled as the number 1 solution because I had almost never heard of the problem before. Additionally, I was shocked to see that mass transit didn't even make the top 10 let alone top 25 solutions. I had heard about it so much, so I was expecting to see it higher on the Drawdown list of immediacy. 
    <br><br>

Overall, I left this list feeling a lot more positive and hopeful. This list was very helpful in helping me visualize my personal carboon footprint as well as provide unique insight into the situation as a whole. It was very refreshing to see a list like this that didn't focus on all the negative aspects of climate change. As a result, I felt a lot better about myself and more willing to change. Also, it was nice to not be attacked for once. I will definitely keep this solutions in mind in my daily life as I make choices about what to consume and how to consume it.



<br><hr>
In response to Claire, I agree. This reading was a lot easier to get through compared to let’s say Walden. The summaries made it very clear to see the exact changes that need to be made in order to save the environment. I was also overwhelmed by the amount of data that was provided as it showed me exactly what needs to happen and what changes will have the most effect. 
    <br><br>

One of the most interesting sections was, “Educating Women and Girls.” I thought the most surprising fact was that women who are more educated have fewer and healthier children. I think that is kind of rude because I am an educated adult who dreams of having four children. My grandma went to Stanford and had 5 kids. I just don’t know the statistics behind that. 
    <br><br>

It is also surprising because I would have though the opposite. The more educated a person is, the likelihood they are also wealthier. I would assume that the wealthier a person is the more kids they would want to have because they have the funds to support them. 
    <br><br>

I agree that women need to be educated, but I believe there is room for growth for education for men about Climate Change.




<br><hr>
I was also appreciative of the list, it showed me how much I could actually help environmentally and what aspects of my life and habits I needed to re-evaluate. While I knew that food waste was an enormous problem, and I have been trying to remedy my own waste, I was still surprised by how many of the items on the list pertained to food. It is amazing to think of all of the energy that goes into producing food, from the land, to caring for the plants and livestock, to transporting it to stores for us to purchase…...and then to have us waste so much of what was produced. All that waste, responsible for 8% of global emissions, and yet we still have people starving.



<br><hr>
Within today's emission of CO2, the environment will only deteriorate along with the change in time. I found it effective as well from those summaries, which means that I do agree with you. Turns out, it can be extremely easy for normal people like me to contribute to the environment. And those data are stunning to me as well. It gives me a better and clear image too. A little change in life can be significant to the future of this planet.
    <br><br>
To be honest, most of the advertisement has a purpose is to stimulate the sales of a product. Advertisements are not effective, and most of the advertisements today are like food, new tech products, and fashion. As you said that the advertisements are not common with content like encouraging a plant-based diet. Television could be a tool, but in the US, most of the channels are private-owned and it is difficult to promote some of the information on the big screen. What is behind is that people do not want to destroy their benefit.
    <br><br>
However, personally, I do not agree with the plant-based diet. As you said Instagram and youtube are good platforms for promoting climate crisis. But I think this issue can be approached in other ways, not through a plant-based diet. There is some famous bloggers post about their vegan life, and plants are the only things they consume. And recently news came out on some bloggers' health issues and drives them to eat meat again. The human body needs various nutritions in order to sustain itself. The celebrities who only eat plants have a medical team to tell them to take supplements while only eating plants. But those bloggers cannot afford it.
    <br><br>
It is true that we need to reduce the CO2 in the year, but people need to do it scientifically efficient.



<br><hr>
I agree with what you said very much. Same as you, I also grew up with the idea that turn off the home lights when leaving or switching off chargers when not using can save the energy and make a lot of positive efforts in the aspect of climate-changing. However, after knowing “switching off your charger of mobile phones for one day is used up in one second of car driving,” and knowing the fact that changing to LED light bulbs is nearly ten times less effective than reducing the food wastes, I was shocked. However, this doesn’t mean that the actions we did in the past to save the environment were in vain. Rather than that, it means we have more efficient methods to achieve that goal right now, thanks to the “Drawdown Project” and other similar articles.
       <br><br>
  Just like Ken said in his lecture, the climate crisis can be addressed in two ways: both personal and collective. Personally speaking, food waste can be seen as the most important contributor to greenhouse gas, but individuals can successfully reduce our carbon footprint by lessening the food we waste. There are about one-third of food wasted during the process from farms to the dinner tables worldwide, and food wasted contributed to roughly 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However, we can address this problem simply by not nitpicking foods or just purchasing the amount which we can consume. Collectively speaking, the level of women's education ought to be increased. In the “Summary of Solution,” it says that women with more education tend to have fewer and healthier children. To achieve this goal, society and institutions should make schools more affordable, helping girls overcome health barriers, reducing the time and distance to get to the schools, and make schools more “girl-friendly.” I think by both addressing climates changing personally and collectively, just like Ken said, the greenhouse gases will not only be halted but also drew down.

I was also intrigued to learn of all the top effective ways in which we can help the environment and cut carbon emission. It was to my surprise that refirenant management was one of the top ways to reduce CO2 emission instead of what many may think would be oil fracking and or land use. I agree that the website was very informative as it had summaries for each way in which it would affect the total global emission as well as the cost for action. It's interesting to see that there are many different ways that we can reduce carbon emission however these projections given by the website do not make me any more optimistic about the climate crisis then I am. The reason for this is because most of the ideas in the list requires people, governments, and nations to collaborate on a regulatory carbon emission system which would take time to implement as well as effort. I believe that the climate crisis is ever growing due to the ignorance that accompanies it. Many do not make a change because they do not know the impact of their choices. One point that supports this would be the education of women or people in general. Not only will it cause the population to fluctuate at a smaller rate, it will also give people the basic common sense and practicality to make a change. Once everybody is educated on how the climate impacts them and in turn they impact the climate, then we will be able to see bigger change then this website could project.

I am also shocked that markets today will fail to promote the best methods needed in order to save our planet from surely the inevitable. I feel like we also talk down the power of social media too much,as you had said in your comment, and that we should harness its power to make an impact as well as make strides towards becoming a more eco friendly planet. I believe that mass advertisements and making the environmentally friendly lifestyle “trendy” would cause many people to change their habits in favor of this new trend. By making it seem cooler than it actually is, I feel like we could convince the masses of this new lifestyle while at the same time preventing our planet from dying out.  While reading all of these solutions, the amount of money it took to implement them increased exponentially as I continued on. While many may see this as an obstacle, we have to put into perspective how much money the government is spending in other departments that could possibly go towards funding to save our planet. For example, the United States government spends $500 billion plus dollars on a military that we don’t even use that often. Imagine the impact we would have in terms of moving to a more sustainable world if we spent even a quarter of that on changing practices and reducing our carbon footprint!

I remember when switching to LED lights was a huge deal back when the craze about them saving a "ton" of energy compared to incandescent lightbulbs came about. I believe this movement was so large because the companies producing incandescent light bulbs could easily start to produce LEDs and sell them to their customers. When it comes to food, I wondered why more restaurants and grocery stores weren't making the sustainable switch, and I believe it all comes down to the customers. I used to be a vegan, and when I brought plant-based meat to lunch with my friends or to a barbecue, nobody would even give it a single taste. For my birthday I requested to go to an all plant based Chinese restaurant with my family, and each one of them (all meat eaters) was apprehensive to try anything. Even if they took a bite and liked it, not knowing what the vegan meat was made out of turned their stomach. While many of us know most vegan meat products are soy protein based, there is a good portion of our country that refuses to recognize that vegan meat is even EDIBLE. It becomes extremely taboo to certain people when they believe they are being fed a bunch of strange chemicals instead of the real thing, when in fact most vegan meats contain mostly natural ingredients. When you think about it, real meat is more disgusting. Would you rather eat the flesh of a once living animal or just some soybeans? Maybe I am biased because I could not get anyone to try out my vegan food and it frustrated me, because vegan meats are actually pretty good replacements. I think the public needs to be better informed about these alternatives so they have the desire to try them. Fast food chains are starting to offer plant-based meats and other options, but they seem to be only "limited edition" due to the lack of popularity.



<br><hr>
I, as well, was extremely overwhelmed when hearing the amount of data and statistical values that went into providing the countless solutions mentioned in not just Ken’s introductory video but mainly the reading itself. I cannot agree more that a simple run down of each solution that is designed for the casual reader would be the only thing that would make this reading better, as this would allow for more people (including myself) to grasp a greater understanding of these solutions and come to the realization that they actually aren’t as intense as the seem. Touching on your second point; I think that your viewpoint on plant-based diet commercials vs ones concerning LED lights is interesting and is absolutely true. When thinking about plant based diets and minimalism, if often times comes to mind that these solutions are useful as they will also end up helping you save money, not just the environment. This idea of advertising something that will save someone money is frowned upon in the capitalistic world that we live in, thus, like you stated, displays why commercials for things such as LED lights are far more in number than for those of meat free diets, even though reducing food waste is 10x more effective than switching to a different type of light source. Overall, I really resonated with your comment!

You bring up a good point. When people think of carbon dioxide emissions it's easy to jump to conclusions and blame cars and airplanes but refrigeration is also an essential source of the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere. Since fridges require a lot of energy to cool down the contents inside of it, it must produce a lot of energy, a lot of which escapes in the form of heat from the back to keep its inside cold. This, in turn, releases carbon dioxide. I believe the problem behind refrigerator emissions is that they must be kept on all the time. Fridges are constantly putting out carbon dioxide gas into the atmosphere. Although it might be at a slower pace than cars, the fact that they are constantly in use must be why they are responsible for a huge part of our carbon footprint. However, I was really surprised to learn that refrigerators emit 90 percent of their greenhouse gas emissions at the end of their lifetime. To me, this seems like a more developmental issue more than a consumer issue. If refrigerators cannot be recycled efficiently then maybe they should be altered to be able to do so to prevent the climate crisis.
       <br><br>

Like Jay points out, I would have never expected that refrigeration would be a big concern before watching this video. I always knew that people were talking about switching to an insect or plant-based diet but never realized how detrimental refrigeration could be to the environment during decomposition. I now realize why the beef industry is so devastating to our carbon footprint, not only because of how much energy is required to produce beef but also because of refrigeration. In order to keep the meat cold and preserve it, we must use refrigerators which when recycled then become an environmental hazard. I'm curious to see if electronic devices are also a big part of our carbon footprint because of how common they have become since the 21st century (Also, what about battery use?).



<br><hr>
I agree with the fact that media and marketing tends to be geared towards turning a profit more than sending out an informative and urgent message. Like you said, there's been a generational change in the content of what is posted on social media and the awareness that people try to bring to issues such as eating habits and consumerism. Hopefully, this becomes more and more common as we start focusing on the things that will be truly impactful to minimizing the effects of climate change. Personally, I had no idea that HFCs in refrigerators had such an impact on the ozone layer and the environment. This is a testament to the fact that most mainstream media does not talk about something that is so integrated into American households. Compared to unplugging a charger or turning off a light switch, big industrial companies are not going to endorse the boycott of products that they manage to sell to most Americans. At the end of the day, companies care about revenue. Project Drawdown gives me the hope that more people will turn to legitimate, well-researched sources to become more informed about what they can do both on a personal and communal level to become more environmentally friendly. It begins with people caring enough to take notice and take action.

As much as I enjoyed reading about the optimistic side of the climate crisis, I too was overwhelmed by the amount of data and statistical information. It kinda reminded me of one of Ken’s readings where it explained why no one was more scared or understanding of the severity of the crisis. They blamed it on the numbers being too large/small and abstract so it is hard to understand (like ppm) Similar to this, I find it hard to understand the weight of all this data because the numbers are so large.
       <br><br>

I was very annoyed when Ken pointed out the lightbulb. I thought about all the resources wasted, convincing the public that they were “green” just because they switched their lightbulbs. As difficult as it may be, if the government had begun tackling the actual issues back then, then we would be in a different position than we are now.




<br><hr>
I'm really glad that I'm not the only one who realized this. Lately, there has been this trend to group electric cars with the most efficient methods of lowering co2 emissions. I was pleasantly surprised to see reason 3 and 4, respectively be things that the average person has influence over (what they eat) rather than be these big policies or regulations that wouldn't necessarily be under the average american's control. I would also like to say i think that using youtube, twitter, or social media in general could actually pose some very real issues. I'm not saying it's a bad platform, one of the bests realistically, it's just that Iv'e noticed people will only take action when it is put in front of them in a "consumable" form. Take into account the recent surge in metal straws and hydroflasks. Fueled by internet culture, these trends took off respectively and while this does do good, in my opinion, it shows that the average person will only show initiative and take action when it "makes them look cute" or "boosts their clout" by flexing that they own these products. This is literally also happening with electric cars. People just want to be interested in the newest, shiny thing, not realistic but effective methods to reduce carbon emissions. While I am glad it sparked you to look into ES (and I really hope others do so) I just think we should also remain critical in how environmental studies is being consumed under these platforms.

Seeing a concrete list for solutions to the climate crisis was very interesting. Many of the solutions high up on the list were things that I have never thought of before. Things like educating women and clean cookstoves are things that need social change, but I have never thought of their impact on the environment. This list is important because it is able to open the readers' eyes to the changes we need to make.
       <br><br>


Food waste also caught my eye as an interesting factor in our carbon footprint. While I knew it is something that needs to be worked on I had no idea of the scale of its impact. Like you mentioned there is very little discussion of this and it is not something that we see in advertisements the same way we see advertisements for LED lighting. It is another clear example of the theme of aggressive capitalism. The idea of switching to LED lights is pushed on us because it forces us to go out and buy something new. While there are other issues that are much more important, social changes like cutting back on food waste do not help the rich sell more. Because of this, it falls out of the discussion to make way for ideas that push consumerism, like buying LED lights.



<br><hr>
I found this list very effective and helpful as well. On this list are some things I can focus on in my daily life, like food waste and a plant-based diet. There were three solutions that caught my attention on the list of 25. The first was a plant-based diet. I have considered switching to a vegetarian or mostly plant based diet. I imagine that sometime in the future I will attempt to make the switch. I already try to eat some of my meals vegetarian, but I know I need to make that more frequent. This might be a difficult solution to carry out, however, as many Americans are stuck or comfortable in their dietary habits. Th second solution that was interesting to me was solar farms. Ranking 8th on the list, I think this is a great solution if there are enough companies and communities that can get on board with it. The only drawback is how much space those solar farms take up. Even with the amount of space needed, they still reduce carbon emissions by a lot. The third solution that peaked my interest was family planning. I had no idea how influential this would be. I think that population is one the major problems that will be the hardest to correct or slow down. If we can control the increase in population, then maybe we could begin to tackle human’s habitual practices that are hurting the environment. Birth control being available to all women would help control the population crisis.



<br><hr>
I completely agree with you and loved how there were multiple ways on how to reduce our carbon footprint and CO2 gas emissions. I mainly thought it was just going to reduce car use, waste less food, and water etc, but I was pleasantly surprised with some of the solutions. For example, the refrigerators were something I didn't expect because I never thought how much CO2 gets released when creating and throwing out fridges and the chemicals it uses to chill food. Another example, I did not expect was the one that said: "educate girls." When I first read the title, I was a bit offended to be completely honest but then I realized that girls really do affect the culture food-wise and children wise. So I can see how that solution was an important one. 
       <br><br>
I do wish that more of these solutions were advertised and well known throughout social media because I really do believe that some of them can be easily done however, people just don't know about it. Just like the Cowspiracy documentary, how animal agriculture is not being addressed, these solutions are not being talked about and promoted enough. I do hope people become aware of these solutions and hopefully act on it.



<br><hr>
Is it ironic I this solutions article makes me feel hopeful and optimistic? Even though there are so many things we must change and headaches from sacrifices, I find this detailed plan inspiring because I feel many people have thought out the best strategies to implement. I like the precision and thoughtfulness to compose all these plans, and I really believe we can adjust to a good amount of them or at least the top few. I agree it is very interesting that we see many commercials about switching light bulbs, but that message is not nearly as effective as refrigerator management or food conservation. For trustworthy marketing, the government or a credible source should be putting these ideas in people's heads, instead of companies trying to profit from it. Manipulation harms the environment by lag time it takes to debate the issue rather than doing something about it. All we have to do is abide by these strategies and be more selfless.



<br><hr>
I, too, really enjoyed reading through the list of the top effective ways of reducing greenhouse emissions. I thought one fact that was really interesting to me was that refrigerant management was one of the most effective ways to cut down the CO2 emissions. This idea never crossed my mind until after reading this list which was very beneficial because I feel as though we are getting more and more ways to contribute to save our environment. I agree with your thought that the statistical portion was very confusing but I think that in the end they were able to get the idea across. 
        <br><br>
The two aspects that Ken mentioned within his video seemed like they were doable things. First- the personal ways we can cut down on the greenhouse gas emissions are through transportation, production of food, and housing. I believe that I can accomplish those three aspects personally by doing the following: choose a different option as opposed to flying; eat smaller portions and use what I buy; and finally chose to live in a manner that is minimalistic and realistic to help the environment. Second- the number one thing that we can do globally is to waste less food and eat a plant based diet, in which I think will definitely be difficult as a whole to accomplish but we will never know if we don’t come together and try everything that we can do to fulfill the environments needs.



<br><hr>
Yes. We honestly need to push awareness in new ways. Vegan/Environmentally friendly things are never advertised. I agree that it would help introduce and help make fighting the climate crisis as more convenient. One of the ways I got introduced into veganism was through things like YouTube and Instagram so I think pushing these lifestyle changes could make a large impact. We get advertisements for things like Tesla’s but these things won’t make a dent in tackling the climate crisis like lifestyle changes. We need cultural reformation in this country not more eco friendly consumerism.



<br><hr>
I found this list to be effective and very insightful as well as to what we an do individually to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Refrigeration definitely caught me by surprise as I had thought the problem was solved in 1987; I did not think about its substitution and if it had potential negative impacts as well. However, this list explains it all and what steps can be taken to better the future of our planet. When I see that solutions will impact a source greater than the other, it only makes me think that attacking the smaller gas emissions will add up as well and can contribute largely to the reduction of emissions altogether. The larger numbers play a huge role, but the smaller ones which seem to have less cultural impacts (compared to food consumption or transportation) should be able to contribute largely altogether. I completely agree with your statement on being more aware of information advertised as corporations do not always have the best intentions. We have to question everything to begin finding the answers to our questions on our own and trust specialists, scientists, etc. who have studied in their field for years rather than corporations/industries who have made it clear their intentions are money-driven.



<br><hr>
I agree with your comment. Project Drawdown really narrowed down all the things we could do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While I thought that the main causes such as transportation, solar energy and wind energy would predominate the top of the list, I found out that most were not even on the top 25! This was surprising for me because I always thought these were the main sources of pollution. At that instant, I realized that the press and the media have been given false statistics about the main pollutants in our world (what a surprise). Don't get me wrong, these sources also pollute the world but not as much as food waste and a meat-based diets. Ken emphasized the importance of working collectively and individually to decrease emissions of CO2 and other gases. We need to really work on ourselves on a personal level and criticize the way we live our lives. Most of us are hypocrites who "defend" the environment, yet don't do anything meaningful to change the way they consume or eat or pollute the world. I am saying this because I have been victim of this. I've said this before but if we can change our families lives to be more aware of their carbon footprint, then we will be on the right track. As we start noticing significant changes in our population, we can then proceed to the global population. Improving the environment by decreasing greenhouse emissions is not an individualistic task. Either we are all in or all out.
        <br><br>

Project Drawdown is not asking for major changes in our lives or changes we can't handle. Such changes require self-conviction from our parts. I encourage everyone in this class to share the link to the web page to friends and acquaintances so they can be better informed of what changes in their lives could be more meaningful. We need to spread the word and do it fast. People cannot complaint about project drawdown as a complex document as it only summarizes the ways we can improve the environment in a couple of paragraphs. I also got really overwhelmed with all the statistical data provided, but I quickly realized that it was most important to understand the main idea of each point and its corresponding reduction of greenhouse emissions.

I really like the way you phrased your response to this reading, it hit all of the points that I wanted to make as I was doing the reading and then watching Ken’s video. First of all, I agree with you that a roadmap of exact solutions was very helpful. Second one thing that also stood out to me was the unreliability and misguided intentions of the media and advertising in mitigating this crisis.  Your example with the LED bulbs I felt was very strong and compelling. I feel as though the media is a force that we need to overcome as a movement, the market and the media need to work to benefit all of us, not juse those turning a profit, one way to guarantee this mutual benefit is to advertise things that benefit our planet. The big ideas in this video, that is in relation to land use and food do seem a big obstacle to overcome in terms of fighting big companies, but I believe as a movement we can prove to people just how important these changes really are. Finally, the trends that you mentioned that are inspiring hope are trends that also stand out to me as I also began my particiaption in the activism of this movement via posts on Instagram and often still hear about new developments on that platform. One last thing I wanted to mention was the importance of educating women that was mentioned many times, this is a point that I thought could use yet another mention in my comment as not only is it vastly important but also vastly beneficial on many fronts.



<br><hr>
I totally agree with you that after read the top 25 articles, I realized how wrong we were about cut down emissions. It is never things that sounds fancy such as nuclear power or solar power. In fact, it is actually the easy and small things around our life. What is more that doing these things are actually good for us. That means when you are doing little things and make little changes, you are not only benefiting the environment largely, you are also making yourself better. For example, eating less meat will not only be better for the earth, it is also much more health for our body and save a lot of money from medical care. Just like you said, the only groups that are not happy is the food company and medical company who can not make money anymore. They are changing the facts just to make sure they can make still make money. Just like you, I really enjoy reading these lists because they are just so easy, so small and so beneficial. Just like you said, all these things should be better known to everyone to reveal the true facts about science and join the battle of saving our world.



<br><hr>
I agree that the advertisements and media are always misguiding because they need to make money from it and it is useful to focus on the changes in our lifestyle. Solutions like switching to a plant-based diet or changing chemicals in refrigerator is rarely advertised since they are not profitable. If people only get information from press and media, they will definitely be misguided. In addition, I think the reading for this week is useful, since information supported with precise statistics is really convincing and persuasive. It at least gives some practical and detailed solution, and it also points out the effects if we have fulfilled the solutions.



<br><hr>
I completely agree, I found this very helpful because I have been trying to figure out personal things I can do even if it's only a very small change. This should be information circulating far more widely. The variety of statistics really puts everything in perspective, and urges individuals to change. I enjoyed how cut and dry project drawdown was, it just gave the straight facts. The summery aided me as well considering is outlined the overall picture, and it was helpful when it came to intercropping because I wasn't understanding that.
        <br><br>

You are totally right in the sense that we cannot rely on the media when it comes to climate change. We live in a consumeristic society and the media is only another means of projecting this making it largely unreliable. Big corporations don't care about OUR planet, they care about money in there pocket because their thinking is so short term. I wasn't surprised at how insignificant of a change led lightbulbs really generate, its just another thing to buy and consume so its just a bandaid on a wound that needs stitches really. I think a good beginning of this is plant based diets, however I think it'll take a while for that to become largely popular.



<br><hr>
I feel that educating girls should be higher on the list because having more people educated on the subject matter will be more beneficial in the long run. Also the fact that 62 million girls don't have the access to get a proper education is just unethical. Family planning should be way up there too because we really need less people on this planet; the more people there are the more we have to use the earth's resources to take care of them. I too was appreciative of the list of solutions because I didn't know what I could do to live a more sustainable and environmentally friendly lifestyle. I was surprised to see that food waste was not at the top of the list and that refrigerant management was, I guess fixing your fridge helps reduce food waste by having a better storage for it and it prevents all the emissions that would be released into the atmosphere when it's reaching the end of it's function. When I was a kid, a group of speakers came to my elementary school and introduced these house appliances that are more eco-friendly than normal ones and I went along with it not knowing that domestic water use has little to no effect on the actual climate. I thought that in order to be environmentally friendly I just had to change the ways I used water in my house by taking shorter showers and remembering to turn off the faucet. I don't know why we weren't taught these solutions on this list at an earlier age, I feel that learning this would have influenced the way we acted back then.



<br><hr>
This reading connects with the film Cowspiracy in regard to how the promotion of a largely plant-based diet isn't promoted as much as other environmentally friendly solutions. Like you mentioned, growing up I also always saw advertisements that promoted switching to eco-friendly light bulbs and turning off the lights once you left a room. Although I know these are also helpful, they are nowhere near as helpful as going vegetarian or vegan. The amount of water that goes into feeding one cow is insane; this ties together with another point which is food waste. We Americans tend to waste about a third of what we produce for small insignificant reasons. This is causing a waste of water and resources that we no longer have the privilege to lose.



<br><hr>
I also like the different ways to reduce greenhouse gasses. But as I see it, food is one of the main problems throughout the list. I feel that this would be the easiest and most effective fix. I feel that we do not need to produce the maximum amount of food to survive. We are going to fast in our food production which causes us to waste food at a faster rate. We are also highly demanding food that takes in more resources which causes problems of climate change and lack of resources. But it is great that they were short and went straight to the point of what we had to do in order to reduce our greenhouse gasses emissions. 
        <br><br>
I agree I feel that platforms like Instagram and Youtube can help a lot of spreading and give an understanding of the climate crisis. Popular people can showcase how being environmentally friendly as a new trend. They can showoff how effective solar panels are for the world. They can also show how meat is not that great to eat which causes less demand in eating meat. All in all, Creators on youtube and Instagram could change viewers' point of view about the environment.



<br><hr>
While I do agree with your point, I think a big takeaway from the summary of solutions is the fact that we have multiple outlets/approaches we can take to help reduce emissions. Even if someone is fixated on eating meat for the rest of their lives, changing to LED light bulbs and reducing waste is still beneficial to the environment. I think it's important to make all the change that is necessary, which is why the list is comprised of 100 solutions, not just the top 3. 
        <br><br>
To add onto your other point, it really was quite an overwhelming amount of statistics to be read and examined at a single time. However, it really is nice to get a perspective on how impact certain actions can be. I think this list is great for the average person who doesn't know much about carbon emissions, especially considering how concise and well-formatted each summary was. I kinda expected this week's reading to consume a lot of time, but the graphics and simplistic descriptions really helped the process.



<br><hr>
I really liked how you used the example of lightbulbs being talked about heavily in advertisements for helping in saving the planet while there are bigger issues that are not talked about, such as the consumption of meat. Project Drawdown does a great job of giving us a list of many solutions for huge causes of the climate crisis, and making us realize to not only trust the media. It is crazy to see that a lot of the solutions in the top 25 fall into the food sector, with “Reduced Food Waste” being number 3. It is also crazy to see that “Educating Girls” is ranked much higher than LED lighting. “Educating Girls” is ranked at number 6 while LED lighting is at number 44, but why is it that we have been told more about LED lighting? I am glad that science will always tell us the right things or at least do a much better job than the media.



<br><hr>
The most striking realization about all of these “solutions” to climate change is that so many of these are not even solutions in the first place--but rather very simple lifestyle changes that can fundamentally change so much of our climate footprint: by as much as half. Compounding this interesting realization is the balance between personal and global change in the top 3 solutions to the climate crisis. The implementation of wind turbines onshore would cost trillions of dollars, but the reduction of HFCs and the shift to a plant based diet would compensate entirely for these changes. All in all: the most powerful shifts are simple and, more importantly, free! But the barriers to these apparently simple solutions to climate change are where their challenge really comes into place: it is much easier to tell people that they need to pay more in taxes in order to pay for wind turbines then it is to tell them that they need to fundamentally change their lifestyles, diets, and education processes. People--including myself before this class--want climate change to be an issue that does not have to be tackled at the personal level. The fact that it needs to become a very personal and a global issue at the same time is what makes the climate crisis so seemingly simple and yet so complicated: we are all culpable and we are all capable of creating a solution: we need to work as individuals and as a collective.



<br><hr>
I agree with your comment. It's interesting to see how the media could be making a positive impact on climate change through just advertising, but choose not to so they don't lose profit. I also enjoyed seeing all the alternative things we could be doing to make our CO2 emissions decrease. I agree that the data and statistical information is slightly overwhelming, but I also think its necessary to include. If people don't see the cold hard facts then I don't think they'll really understand the scope of the issue.
        <br><br>
Addressing the advertisements for a plant-based diet, I think in this day and age we are seeing much much more of this. For example, Burger King and Carl's Jr. started offering plant-based burgers. So now people can still enjoy their greasy fast food while also cutting down their emissions.




<br><hr>
It made me hopeful seeing such a comprehensive solution.  I agree with you Claire that I found some of the things on the list shocking because a lot of the things that we are told to do to help climate change aren't even that effective. What I found most exciting about the plan was the diversity in subject matte. From family planning to agriculture to renewable energy, this plan has everything. We are in a time where we must begin to  call different peoples' talents together when dealing with climate change. What I found most exciting about Project Drawback is that everyone has a place where they can fit into the plan.People who are interested in agriculture and food justice can enter into that field. People who are interested in engineering can do something renewables. People need to use their passions towards something positive.



<br><hr>
You make a really good point about what this reading reveals about the media Claire. I didn’t even think about it because reading each solution, I was just amazed by the clarity and amount of data it had to back it up. There was a strong sense of truth and facts in each solution. But then comparing it to the media and how solutions are presented to regular individuals, it makes me incredibly mad that people try to take advantage of trends for their own economic gain.

I agree that trends and social media have been a good way for people to become engaged about the climate crisis and it does give them hope on ways they can take individual action. However, I feel like social media can do more to address the real solutions that Project Drawdown proposes for even more educational purposes because it would shed light on the choices that we as individuals are making to support solutions such as electric cars that aren’t nearly as impactful as the other Top 25.

It's interesting that you say this, because it made me reanalyze how I saw meat growing up versus how I see it now. When I was younger I would have 100% said that things like switching to LED lights, taking shorter showers, or driving a hybrid car were the best thing you could do to save the environment. After reading this article, I was trying to remember when my attitude shifted so drastically for me to become vegetarian, and I realized it was in college. UCSB fosters a very environmentally friendly and crunch vibe that encourages students to be conscious of their environmental footprint, whether they're an environmental studies major or not. We bike everywhere, provide lots of vegetarian and vegan options in the dining hall, and live on a beach we want to protect! This awareness has allowed me to understand the effects of meat, but a lot of the worlds population isn't in such a fortunate situation to gain this understanding. This is why it is so much easier for them to switch to LED lights and claim themselves environmentalists.

I totally agree with you that the amount of statistical information is very overwhelming however the summaries of each solution have brought me the attention of many problems I do not even think of! First off the solution for refrigerant management is definitely something I do not think of daily and I cannot believe it is ranked first! I found it very interesting that preventing leakage is something that could truly help the environment. Moreover, I totally agree that the list of the top effective ways to reduce carbon is very helpful when trying to reduce carbon emissions because I completely agree with you that as a kid everybody talks about switching light bulbs to save the environment. Now, people talk about not using plastic straws or use reusable bags. Yes, of course, everybody should do this however the effects of not using a straw vs. reducing food waste is such a ginormous difference. I am not saying that people should stop making these efforts to help the environment, but what I am saying is that people should think of solutions that would help drastically as a whole and continue these small tasks that would also eventually add up to help the environment. Moreover, another solution that quite shocked me and had a high ranking was educating girls. I was fully aware that a higher population causes climate change to progress, however, I did not realize how much of it linked to girl's education regarding birth control. Overall, these summaries were very interesting and I thought that they helped expand my education regarding climate change.

I really agreed with your comments on the media and the advertisers. You mentioned how you saw more about how switching our light bulbs can save our planet. Now it seems that they have found the electric cars to be the new market. Not to mention that just like switching light bulbs, adopting electric cars is not even among the top 25 solutions, producing those cars can still add substantial greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, as Ken said in the lecture before. Your conclusion on this is right. People have been fighting about climate change issues for centuries, and as it gets growing attention, it gets marketers and corporations' attention. They design ads and packaging catering towards our interests, using good hearts to make money while making little actual influence on the environment. We then should have a critical eye to evaluate the information we receive from the ads and the media. An article like "Summary of solutions" deserves people's attention because it is such comprehensive and easy-to-understand, while backed up by data and predictions. Just like Ken said, there are 11 kinds of solutions are related to food, and by wasting less food and adopting a plant-based diet can roll back nearly 150GT CO2. We have no reason to not put it into action now.



<br><hr>
I too appreciate this list that can notify us the most effective and approachable methods of reducing greenhouse gas emission. It’s an interesting fact that most solutions are associated with food and electricity generation. It verifies the idea that mentioned in Ken’s lecture previously, which food is one of five things that people can do to cut their climate footprint in half.
        <br><br>
We indeed should focus more on small changes in our lives, like switching to plant-based diet, instead of thinking about huge changes that were hard to make within our circle of competence. The little things are the key to success, but they are ignored in most cases. By providing such a list, Project Drawdown allows people to know what they can change in daily life. Moreover, I was surprised when Ken mentioned that addressing the 100 most substantive solutions to global warming can not only stop rising greenhouse gas emissions, but also reduce it. At this point, I see the hope to save our planet from long-existing global warming, especially compared to all the readings in the first half of the quarter.



<br><hr>
I have the same kind of appreciative feeling as you do, as Project Drawdown nicely lists the most effective solutions to the climate crisis we are facing, which, just as Ken said in the video, provides “a roadmap to globally reduce our greenhouse gas emissions”. I also agree with your notion of the effect of advertisement and media on our evaluation of the importance of different changes on our environment. As Ken mentioned, most people think solar and wind power are the most effective solution, however, they do not have as big an impact as girls’ empowerment and efficient use of food do. Ken also mentioned that reducing food wastes would be ten times better for the planet than having a self-driving electric car does, which again points out how what the general public perceive as effective (in solving environmental problem) differ from what are really effective. This reveals the effect of environmental communication on people’s mind and accordingly behaviors. Project Drawdown also clearly illustrates the outcomes of the changes that should be done, which allows the readers to vividly perceive the impact of these changes and be more encouraged to take actions. More importantly, this list also reveals the importance of cultural changes to mitigating the climate change, in comparison to technological changes that we tend to emphasize more. Lastly, I also want to say that I especially like Project Drawdown also because it provides solutions based on a global scale, which can be referenced by any country in the world and hence is a roadmap that can promote the biggest changes possible, i.e. global changes.



<br><hr>
After reading the “Summary of Solution” in Project Drawdown, I was also surprised by the different projections we could focus on that would allow us to lower our emission as a whole. Each segment was provided with very detailed statistics and numbers, including gigatons of CO2 could be reduced, net cost, and life time net profit. Even though Ken just assigned us to read the first 25 projections, I scanned through all of them. I found many of them to be solutions we had discussed during class, which made me feel very happy because our lectures actually matched with something official. The one I found to be the most interesting would be number 4, bamboo production. This is the first time I learned that “Bamboos rapidly sequesters carbon in biomass and soil and can thrive on degraded lands.”

After reading the checklist of what is the most effective to do, I am greatly impressed just as you do. Technology is not the most important element in this process, and Elon Musk is not fully correct. New energy vehicles are not even inside the top 25. Some social issues like female education appear to be much more important. From this perspective, doing such things like educating women is profitable, as it not only helps mediate the environmental issue, but also helps change the inequality of the society. Actually social inequality, the rich of wealth in a small proportion of wealthy people is closely linked to environmental pollution. As power and wealth concentrate in a small number of people, the ideal condition of society well-being cannot be achieved and what happens can only be the wealthy damp rubbish on the poor and neglect their exacerbating living condition. Refrigerant replacement is the third, and this is not expected by me either. As you have said, we regarded this as an antiquated issue that refrigerant is doing harm to the ozone layer and several regulations have been passed and this is the end for this issue. However, we oversimplified the condition with HFC still a greenhouse producer. Of course, I think this issue is the easiest to deal with in the first three main issues, which is quite charming.



<br><hr>
I do believe that Science is going to offer us a brighter future, despite the climate change we are having right now....



<br><hr>
I agree with you and I appreciate the listing of solutions we can do to improve our living environment. Before reading it, I didn't notice two things. The first is that there are so many ways both individuals and government can conduct to help our climate. Second is that how things I regard previously as saving the planet is actually not helpful at all when taking the problem to a larger scale. Just like what Ken said in the video, people think it's enough to save the planet through discharging their phones. However, the impact of not charging our phones a total day will be depleted through one second of driving. To be honest, this truth scares me. I haven't realized how small and powerless individuals can be when facing the huge problem. 
        <br><br>
However, on the other hand, we human beings can be so powerful when we aggregate together. When our behaviors aggregate together, it can conquer the troubles. If this list of solutions are being studied and popularized on a larger scale, I'm sure more meaningful behaviors will be conducted.
        <br><br>
The technology and social medias are changing our lives tremendously and we can use them wisely to transmit the information to people who haven't noticed the seriousness of the problem. We should popularize a brand new trend of "helping the earth through practical actions".




<br><hr>
I like your view so much.  After I read the reading, the author suggests a lot of ways to help us to reduce the greenhouse gases we release. And I know some of the suggestion that we think is very helpful for reducing greenhouse gases is not helpful at all. For example, we think we unplug the iPhone charger when we are not using can help reducing wasting a lot, but the truth is not. The hundred times we do this, the energy we save is even less than a minute we drive. The author sad the charger is like bailing the Titanic with the TSP. This really surprises me.



<br><hr>
The statistics provided with the list offers me a close look at how each solution can significantly benefit the climate and us. To me, It’s really interesting how you brought up the fact that marketers use not entirely correct information to attract consumers and maximize their profits. And, being reminded of the fact, I realize that we should not aimlessly follow what other people say about climate crisis, and to solve the issue of climate crisis, we need to, on the other hand, understand what exactly is going on by approaching scientific fact. Once we truly understands the situation, we can be able to make specific plans for actions to mitigate the crisis, while educating other people who are still skeptical.



<br><hr>
After reading the article and watching Ken's lecture, I couldn't agree more with you. I never realized that things that are embedded into our brains about helping reduce our carbon footprint are only the things that people can make money off of. And these things technically do help reduce our carbon footprint, just not nearly as to the extent that we need it to. I too believe that we cannot rely on the media and advertisers to tell us how to solve these issues, because ultimately they only have their best interests at heart. Also, I think the making of a lot of climate change documentaries like the ones we watch for thus class leave me hopeful as well; I think a lot of people are in the dark about climate change and everyone needs to learn what they really can do to save our planet.



<br><hr>
I agree. As a firm believer in capitalism and the free market, I hate to see it fail in such a way that it puts millions of people in direct peril and puts the entire planet at risk. I agree that a radical shift away from the consumer lifestyle and worshipping large companies is necessary to effectively combat the climate crisis. It is much easier for the average American to buy a Prius and LED light bulbs and claim that they are fighting for the environment than to forfeit meat and to stop using their air conditioning. Hopefully trends like veganism and social media and creator-driven content stay around and continue to contribute to media driven by the people rather than corporations



<br><hr>
I agree with what you say about social media and the regular media. Being vegan and other things that are more impactful in helping our environment aren't being represented in the media such as the news or tv shows. The only thing we see are advertisements on the boxes of LED lights that say they are better for the environment but these little things aren't as impactful as things such as changing the way you eat. The one great thing we have going on right now is social media.  Most of this new generation is on social media and they are always trying to start new trends. The great thing us they have started the trend of being vegan. Celebrities post pictures of themselves with their plant based food and other ways of being sustainable which then leads their followers to be influenced by them. Changing your lightbulbs can only do so much. Our generation needs to step it up and take action for change.



<br><hr>
I also found it very helpful to look at this list of effective ways to reduce carbon emission and greenhouse gasses. I think that it is very helpful to have all of these areas played out because it can be a bit overwhelming in todays day and age because it can seem like everything is harmful to the environment so it is hard no navigate what is important to focus on. It was really useful to put them side by side and be able to look at them qualitatively. I decided to sort the topics based on their contribution in Project Drawdown's "Scenario 1" because that should really be the goal of stopping climate change close to 1.5 degreed Celsius. I was not surprised that by this sorting two of the top three topics were Reduce Food Waste and Plant-Ritch Diets, because these are pretty widely known topics when discussing how to be eco-friendly. I was surprised, however that the number two topic was Health and Education. I was not sure at first what that meant. Reading into it I now understand how educating girls and focusing on family planning can dramatically reduce the global carbon footprint. Another surprising topic that came up at the top of the list was Refrigerant Management. I assumed a little that refrigerators and air conditioning systems weren't great for the environment but I had no idea how awful the HFC's that replaced the old and detrimental CFC's and HCFC's still are!



<br><hr>
I found that your comment on the advertisement of light bulb switching and the media to be very interesting, and I've had the same experience. I've grown up, I too watched those commercials about switching to LED light because they will save our planet, and then also by using less energy. LED lights are so popular now because the media has portrayed them in such a way that they've become so mainstream, and anything else seems almost retro or backward, which of course LED lights can make a pretty significant dent in energy usage, but that same media campaign can be used for other habits that can increase our sustainability even more and that has so much potential. If the media and companies were to almost brutally advertise a plant-based diet or severe reduction in food waste in that way, it would have the potential to become mainstream as LED's did and imagine the impacts that would have. However, of course, the large companies and media outlets won't endorse something that won't make them money, but they do consider demand for content, and if we keep including shows and other things involving these sustainable habits and create enough demand, it would push those corporations and such to potentially endorse such habits.



<br><hr>
I appreciate the list, too! After half quarter of waiting to obtain actually effective way of solving climate crisis, finally we have the list of things that everyone of us can do to help defuse the situation. I also felt overwhelmed by the amount of data provided for each solution but it presents its credibility and convinced me to do as the list tell me to do. 

        <br><br>

I also agree that how companies want to take advantages on every situation in order to gain more profit. In the world of capitalism, profit is the only thing that matters and I feel pityful yet lucky that companies like Burger Kings are introducing plant based foods because it becomes a trend which means now veggies foods have a bigger market thanks to social media which set the trend. We should utilize social media to advocate things to save our planet such as the list.



<br><hr>
I agree, Project Drawdown is a great way to inform people of the changes they could make by having access to something like the Table of Solutions provided. It was a lot of information to take in, but I don’t think it was too overwhelming. I do also have some knowledge on these numbers but it’s only recently that this has happened through classes I have taken here at UCSB as an environmental studies major. Making the numbers more comprehensible to everyone would be an improvement, but I agree that the summaries of the solutions make the information easier to understand. 
        <br><br>
I really like how you brought up the bias in the media coverage regarding the actions we can take to combat the climate crisis. We constantly are told these tiny changes will save the world and often are not educated on much more impactful actions we could be taking. Like when we were younger, we’re always told to turn off the light when you leave a room and recycle.  Both are great habits but that doesn’t equate to combating the climate crisis. For the most part, money controls the media. Social media is a great way to spread ideas on ways to be more environmentally conscious such as thrifting becoming a trend. More people are doing it because many social media influencers are doing so.



<br><hr>
I really agree with you, and the list of ideas to bring our CO2 emissions down is useful. But the complexity of the data left me wondering which way to go.I decided to start with what I could do.At the same time, many of the green ways advertised are not as effective as we think, such as led lights.It's true that companies and businesses are more likely to advertise things that are less efficient but bring them more revenue because they are not profitable in the farming industry, as you say.So I think if we really want to solve these problems, we should not just read the propaganda in the newspapers and on TV, but look up the information by ourselves and do these more efficient things spontaneously.



<br><hr>
After reading your comment, I have a sense of agreement regarding the most important issue about the current issue. I believe that self-interest always plays an essential role in every decision that companies have made. Undoubtedly, every enterprise wants to maximize its profits and attract customers to buy more products. However, they often overlook the social benefit while they make their decisions. Refer back to your comment, I have been hearing and watching a lot of advertisements about LED Lights as well throughout my life. The role of advertisements is to attract more people to buy, but I think we should not simply trust every advertisement we saw because of the benefits they showed to you. In some cases, it might not be truly authentic. What we need to do is to listen to the ideas of experts because they have done numerous research and had strong evidence about what we should act. I strongly believe this is a better way to think about our current situation and choose to listen to experts.

I found it really interesting to know that refrigerant management was one of the effective means of reducing carbon dioxide emissions. It's one of the last things that come to mind when it comes because refrigerators don't seem all that relevant to fossil fuel combustion, so it was quite eye opening to know that switching to natural refrigerators can reduce the temperature to 1 degree Fahrenheit. This week's reading painted a very practical and straightforward picture of what really needs and can be done to cut down carbon dioxide emissions with solutions ranging from changing the culture surrounding food waste to promoting health and education especially those of women to switching to more efficient technology.

It was great having the option to view an article that gave me a look at trust in our future. A great deal of the readings we have been appointed have left me miserable and caused me to lose trust in our lives and condition. I thought that it was charming that this article introduced a wide range of points that demonstrated how we could diminish Co2 outflows in basic manners.. 
        <br><br>

I knew the condition of environmental change was horrendous however the initial hardly any long stretches of class were entirely cynical. There was for the most part talk about the issue yet nothing yet of arrangements. 
        <br><br>

All things considered this perusing gave numerous arrangements that we can actualize in our day by day lives now. The one that I would express addressed me the most was that of the to a great extent plant-based eating regimen. I know from firsthand experience that many individuals will say that they won't do it in light of the fact that their way of life won't permit it whether it be inexpensive food is modest and ample, or you eat what your family makes. 
        <br><br>
I saw this rundown as both instructive and moving. The most astounding was the way that overseeing refrigeration is the most compelling thing we can do to stop environmental change. In any case, the one that I need to concentrate my remark on was the one with respect to Tropical Rainforests. As referenced in the investigation, the rainforest spread has diminished from 12% of land spread to 5%.

This reading was very interesting as I enjoyed learning about the most effective ways of cutting CO2 emissions.This reading included many facts and statistics related to CO2 emissions. One fact I thought found interesting was that reducing food waste could have 10x the effect of switching to LED lights. With that being said, we need to start considering our food portions and make changes to reduce waste in the US, and even globally.  Another major way of cutting CO2 emissions is transitioning to a plant-rich, or plant-based diet. This reduces ones carbon footprint drastically and has many health benefits. This has become more popular in the US in recent years, as I have seen many plant-based restaurants open up around my house. Another topic discussed in the reading was that of educating women. I was a little confused by this at first, but it makes sense for the benefits of family planning. They said that women who are more have less and healthier children, which contributes to the population problem we have. The most surprising thing that I learned was that refrigerators are the leading contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. We can easily shift to using more natural refrigerators that do not emit CO2. All in all, there are many ways we can cut CO2 personally, and globally. We must educate people of these ways and spread awareness to the climate crisis cause.

I really liked how this week's reading had so many different solutions, it was nice to read about the first 25. One that particularly stood out to me was the geothermal solution. Interesting how 39 countries are necessary to provide 100 percent of the world's electricity needs yet we only have tapped into geothermal use at about 6-7 percent. If these 39 countries were to come together and help the rest of the world with the electricity needs we could easily help the planet out. 
        <br><br>
n a side note, I found it funny that the "waste" from the geothermal power plant in Iceland is used at the blue lagoon geothermal spa. The connotation for "waste" usually has a bed rep especially regarding energy sources, but in this case the "waste" is literally just hot water from deep Earth.

I have been surrounded by sustainable agriculture my entire life, and have never really appreciated the beauty behind living on an organic, grass-fed cattle ranch. The ranch practices silvopasture, regenerative agriculture and managed grazing. While I am incredibly proud of the Magruder Ranch and their sustainable practices in beef production, I still chose to become a vegan. In the past, when I have discussed my decision to go vegan to the Magruder family, they responded with frustration, and gave numerous intellectual justifications for supporting farms that practice sustainability, all of which I agree with. They told me that cattle ranching done properly can almost counteract methane emissions entirely, and provided multiple sources to back their argument. They continuously stated that if you only eat sustainable, grass-fed beef you’re still significantly reducing your carbon emissions. Yet what I kept seeing again and again was those same people eating non-sustainably sourced meat. While silvopasture, regenerative agriculture, and conservation agriculture are viable solutions to reduce emissions, they are not an excuse to eat all of the animal products that your heart desires. As Ken stated in his video introducing the reading “the number one thing we can do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to waste less food, and switch to a plant based diet.” I think that if emissions can be greatly reduced with a simple change diet, everyone should go vegan, and then after we gain some control over the climate catastrophe, we implement sustainable cattle farming.

Project Downturn is a comprehensive map of ways to reverse global warming. 11 out of the top 25 are food related and 4 of the top 25 are land use. Combined half of the top 25 solutions are related to food and how we are using the land to grow it. Some of these solutions are centered on improving or land practices that are currently being used. For example, current farming practices destroy the land and creates poor soil this in turn effects efficiency and the amount of crop yielding for that land. Project downturn gives some solution like conservative agriculture, which would preserve the soil, which makes it more resilient to climate related events. Also, improved rice cultivation. The reading noted that rice is a staple for 3 billion people worldwide. By improving its cultivation it could reduce 11.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide being emitted. From this list I have gotten a better understanding of how we are abusing the land we do have which in turn only makes it more difficult for use to have food safety. 

        <br><br>

I agree with you that sustainable agriculture is the future and has been seriously neglected over the past few decades. I also agree with you that I see people verbally supporting sustainable agriculture as an excuse to not adopt a more plant based diet. I myself have been vegan for 4+ years now. The more I learn about it the more I become content with my decision to cut out animal products forever. I appreciate you sharing your experience with going vegan because so many others struggle with that same experience. I personally think it’s difficult for so many because of this backlash they receive from parents or loved ones. I think this is a really sad reality. Many people go vegan for many different reasons but they are all just trying to improve their health, the environment, or the treatment of animals. None of these are bad things yet people expressing their desire to go vegan, are more often then not receiving negative feedback. So I definitely agree with you and Ken that if switching to a largely plant based diet and not wasting any food is going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions then everyone should do there best to put this into practice. Under our current conditions of land use I think going plant based and doing your best to conserve food waste is a great personal way to counteract current land use practices.


<br><hr>
I agree with what you mentioned, and I also think it is sustainable Agriculture is bound to be the trend of animal husbandry in the future. However, I think the focus of the discussion should be how to let people understand the importance of reducing food waste, which is an important part of energy conservation and emission reduction. I agree with your idea of promoting vegan, but not everyone can accept it. If we can make everyone waste less food, I think this is already the case It's very successful. Moreover, I think if everyone becomes a vegan, the meat market will be greatly affected, which will have a great impact on the economic trend. Of course, this may be some extreme speculation, but as mentioned before, the impact on the economy is also an important part of considering this issue.




<br><hr>

I agree with your solution that people should adopt vegan diets and then possibly integrate sustainable, grass-fed beef. Most people who eat sustainable grazed beef do not limit themselves all the time. It’s true that eating sustainable, grass-fed beef is not a justification for eating non-sustainable meat. Project Drawdown emphasizes the importance of a plant-based diet because cattle farming is the cause of one fifth of global carbon emissions. So this method to reduce climate change is complicated, a big part of which is due to the fact that humans can’t be trusted to make the right decisions, but is one of the most effective methods.




<br><hr>
I find your comment very interesting as I have always wondered how small, organic cattle production ranches and farms justify their practice, and now I know that it is possible to do so with a smaller carbon footprint. I am sure that people who eat only grass-fed beef would certainly lower their carbon footprint. When faced with the option between grass-fed and the alternative beef, many meat eaters would probably choose the more sustainable option. However, I do agree with you that most meat eaters would not go out of their way to restrict themselves to only eating sustainable beef. One of my friends actually is very careful and only eats meat if she knows it is sourced sustainably and grass-fed, however, this is not most people. I think this could be a good trend for meat-eaters who simply refuse to go vegan, but it will take a while to become a widespread reality.





<br><hr>


I think your perspective on the issue of eating beef is interesting; having never really been exposed to the cattle industry, it’s cool to hear about sustainable approaches to a typically environmentally destructive industry. 

        <br><br>

After reading what you had to say about the hypocrisy in folks that argue for sustainable beef yet continuously partake in the not-so-sustainable, I was especially thinking about the labels of ‘organic’ and ‘sustainable’ when it comes to our foods. Plenty of folks try to pass off non-organic foods as such, knowing that people will be more likely to buy their product should they be concerned at all about the processes by which their food has been cultivated. This is further perpetuated by fad eating trends that partially act as stimuli for altering how humans eat but essentially only feed into the ‘kitschiness’, or the ‘clout chaser’ aspect, of sustainable eating. 
        <br><br>


In order for real change in our diets, we need to buy into what we say we believe. No turning back on our words simply because we need a burger in our hands right now.

This was my favorite reading by far because it gives me hope that there are things that can be done that will have a positive impact on the environment. Like many others have said, I'm surprised that my refrigerator and air conditioner are the most problematic things in my household. However, the article stated that their carbon emission is most notable at the end of their lifetime, and since my appliances are in good condition then I won't have to worry about that for hopefully a long time. Number 3 and 4 are both related to food, and out of the top 15 are the most achievable for the average person, so I hope that many people will take those things in consideration, because I will. If throwing away less food and eating less meat has such a profound effect on the environment then that just motivates me even further to stick with my goals. I will show this list to my friends and family to show them how they too can make a positive impact, so that they too will hopefully be as motivated as I am to make better changes for themselves and for the environment.

For the most part, I really enjoyed reading the top 25 most effective ways to reduce greenhouse gases. I think that it was good to finally see exactly what things could be done to help low CO2 emissions. I found it most interesting to see the exact numbers of greenhouse gases that are predicted to go down in each of the actions. I also found it straight forward, easy to read and understand. I think this is important because I have oftentimes found myself reading about some of the solutions to climate change and was left confused and unsure about what needed to be done. 
        <br><br>
I found the solution of Women and Girls Family Planning very interesting. I think that this is currently a huge issue and the fact that it contributes so much to the future of CO2 contributions just makes it more problematic. It is scary to think that just by 2050 our population is projected to grow to 9.7 billion and if we don't take proper precautions it could become closer to 10.7 billion. The difference in the 1 billion people would be the difference in about 102.96 gigatons of carbon dioxide. This number also includes the numbers from educating women. I believe this is a good thing to do no matter what and the fact that it would help in climate change would be another substantial benefit.

After viewing The "Table of Solutions" from the Drawdown Project, I have a better glimpse of what I need to do and encourage others to do in order to reduce carbon emissions. Out of the top 25 things we can do to help with Project Drawdown I was already aware of some of these solutions but there were some interesting ones that I did not even think of such as refrigerant management. Although i figured refrigerators and air conditioners do cause some sort of emission due to them being powered by electricity, I did not even think that the chemicals they use to help keep them cold would be such a major factor in carbon emission reduction. I really liked how each solution gives an in-depth summary of how to approach it and then gave results of how much it would reduce carbon emission/ greenhouse gases. I also did not realize having plant-rich diets would cause such a huge impact. I understand that food waste is a big part and key issue to carbon emissions, however i did not realize just making the switch to a more vegetarian diet would help so much.

It saddens me a bit how little attention web-sites like these get. I have never even heard or seen Project Drawdown's website anywhere, and would not have seen it if it was not assigned to read. There are so many helpful solutions, that are accessible to everybody, yet it seems that no one cares. In my opinion, the issue of climate change is way beyond certain individuals spending their entire lives controlling their greenhouse gases emissions when there is an entire world that emits hundreds of times more.  If people are truly going to make the change in their lives in hopes of preventing a catastrophe that is upcoming, it is not important anymore to do it on an individual scale. What becomes important is global action: all around the world people have to realize and implement the habits of being more environmentally friendly. 
        <br><br>
Sometimes I feel hopeless about this. There seem to be so many ways we can help the planet, and they are all laid down and explained to us. Though the examples presented on this website are truly helpful, I don't think many of us will change our way of living simply because it is inconvenient. The climate crisis has to become catastrophic for humans to start actually caring about it :(

The reading for this week really helped somewhat soothe my worries about the whole ordeal of climate change if only by a little bit, knowing that there still exist a variety of solutions to preventing the worst of it to come. It was surprising to see that off all of the solutions, refrigerant management was at the very top which I never would have considered to be the main solution that would combat climate change. Rather, I would have thought that the livestock industry and factory emissions were more responsible in terms of impact. I had heard in classes such as chemistry how CFC's were responsible for depleting the ozone layer before when released by air conditioners and refrigerators, although I was not aware that they had been replaced by HFC's or that even the replacement had harmful effects upon the environment. It goes to show just how much we take these resources for granted without considering the impact they leave, merely buying these things without a care in the world. Granted, refrigeration and air conditioning is certainly a necessity especially in the modern world but more care should be taken to analyze what drawbacks come from the chemicals going into/being released from certain products, and certainly this information must be better publicized to the public buying them. I would now like to do my research before buying a fridge/air conditioner of my own to ensure only natural refrigerants are being used as well as what brands to avoid.

When looking at this list for the first time, I was very surprised to see that refrigerant management is one of the most effective ways to reduce emissions. I instantly thought that it was funny how this cooling devices are cooling one small room while making the atmosphere even warmer. Not only was I surprised by this list , but seeing how I had no idea that refrigerant management can be very important made me wonder about the other things I have no idea about. I think many people like myself would also be surprised to see the #1 thing on that list. This brings me back to my main point, which is that although we are increasing the awareness of climate change, it seems nearly impossible to educate everyone on the planet about this major issue. How can anyone that has no knowledge on the issue know any better? The industries love that we don't seem to care about the damage their products bring to our earth. They love to keep us in the dark and take our money while they get richer. I think this is such a corrupt system and is surprising to me about how the government really lets all these companies get away with all of this.

These solutions focus on reducing the use of resources such as HFC that would emit harmful gas after burnt and fastening global warming and finding new resources with low cost and few pollution like wind energy. But some approaches need a large amount of money to realize and that is almost impossible to put so much money just for a tiny change compared to our lots of habits that caused global warming. And after all, the main things to rollback global warming are wasting less food, having plant-based diet and control population, which we have heard lots of times. As Ken came up with: First, we should make a change from the view of ourselves like a so tiny gesture-- switching off the phone charger when it is not in use, but there are more wasteful ways that let this gesture become meaningless, for example, transportation, housing and the production of our food. And about collective view, these solutions play a role in ideally drawing emissions of greenhouse gas down.

When I first checked out the site, I was a little confused but then became very amazed. It really is a roadmap, and it makes it so easy to tell how much each of these factors is contributing to our global emissions, how much investing in it costs and then how much it can save us. It was crazy to read about these first 25 ways when it's hard for me to honestly even think of a number of ways close to that many. I read up on the common practices like eating a plant-rich diet, reducing food waste, and things like rooftop solar panels to generate energy. Many of which had interesting facts upon it that were all truthful. Limiting or even cutting out my meat consumption can drastically alter my carbon footprint, which is something I'm trying to do more ever since taking this class. Only really buying what I need and using it all up, making sure nothing gets wasted. Imagine how much better our world would be if people and businesses could just donate leftover food. Less work for people and less hungry people. I do appreciate the composting system and especially where I'm from (SF) where we have the Recology initiative in order to create a greener city and environment. 
        <br><br>

My favorite "sectors" to read about though were the ones concerning Land Use. Reading about how the peatlands were this mucky substance that took many years to create but only seconds to release its greenhouse gases into the atmosphere if disrupted. Didn't even know that kind of stuff existed. Also, the agricultural practices like tree intercropping and how much more productive it makes the land. It also looks a lot greener and nicer. It seems to be kind of like a buddy system for plants or a personal trainer for them to help them grow which I think is pretty cool.

In this week’s readings, I wasn’t sure what to expect when I saw the schedule. Looking at the website made me realize that this was a list of rankings that demonstrated the best ways that will help us lower the CO2 emission in the future. Many suggestions that were listed were ones we had already discussed in class or read/seen in the course materials. I was amazed by the amount of things that we as a collective could do in order to stop the process of the climate crisis. 
        <br><br>
I didn’t know that many of these suggestions would not only lower our CO2 emission, but the money that would be spent on these projects would eventually be saved, and sometimes an ever greater savings than net cost. 
        <br><br>
The first ranked suggestion was not one I had ever heard of. The refrigerant management never crossed my mind, mostly because I did not know that phasing out these HFCs would immensely help lower CO2 in the atmosphere. Many of these involve the use of land and energy sources. I can’t believe that a project like this has been created and our governments are not paying attention to it. This is a set of solutions with proof and numbers to back it up and no one is paying attention to it. It is frustrating that we have solutions created like this and we as a collective are not taking action.

I completely agree with you in being frustrated with this situation.  Project Drawdown efficiently lists the ways that we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  I was surprised by the effectiveness of the methods listed in Project Drawdown.  Learning about the climate crisis, I began to become less optimistic about the ways that each of us can individually make a difference in this issue.  Project Drawdown has made me realize that by putting in the effort and everyone doing their part to better the circumstances of our planet, the climate crisis can begin to be resolved.  I think more people need to become aware of the methods listed in Project Drawdown to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  This issue needs to be more frequently talked about so that people can become personally invested in taking this "roadmap."

This list was very informative and the small summaries of each solution was helpful in better grasping how the solution could work. I was surprised to see the number one solution was refrigerant management. It is something I have never really heard of, much less thought about as a viable method to fight climate change. I also found it funny and very sad that if cattle were a nation, they would be third largest global emitter of greenhouse gasses. This goes to show how harmful the entire meat industry is to the planet. Having two of the top 10 solutions being in the food sector is very telling of where people should focus their energy on. In many places, especially in the U.S plant based diets are becoming easier to attain and taste pretty good too. 

        <br><br>

One solution on the list is nuclear power. This has always been of interest to me. Only 29 countries have nuclear power, yet it provides 11% of global electricity. If countries had more of these, electricity use could be exponentially more efficient. I understand it has downsides, but I personally think it has more benefits than harms. New technologies are also being invented that can provide nuclear energy plants with safer methods and less toxic waste.

When I was in high school, I had heard about the influence of the refrigerators that sold popsicles on sides of roads. I had also heard that there are new and renewable sources to replace the polluting ones. I have always thought that this problem had already come to an end way earlier. But I still saw this topic as the first and the foremost origin of emitting pollution.
        <br><br>


According to Ken, the top three origins' pollution rates are the sum of the following solutions'. It is pretty shocking that there is too much carbon dioxide produced by them, and it is very surprising that only by solving the three simple questions can we eliminate almost 66 percent of the total greenhouse gas. Plus, these three ones are also not hard ones to really follow the suggestions. 
        <br><br>


I especially want to talk about the third one, food waste. The waste of food is always a huge problem in America. In dining halls, most of the food is thrown away because they do not taste good. For example, I took a dish of fish and had a bite. It tastes bad. So I threw it away. I took a bowl of salad. I took too much. I cannot finish them all. So I threw the remaining of it. What I want to propose is that either the dining hall change the meal plans from buffet to a limited amount or improve the taste of food or let students eat outside campus with meal plans.

In response to your high school experience in which you heard that the the refrigerators that sold popsicles on the sides of roads as a source of pollution, I would have not believed that statement until taking this course. I too thought problems of pollution from things such as refrigerators would have been solved by now. Then Ken mentioned the top three origins for pollution rates and the  sum of their following solutions I could not believe that some of the measures had not already been taken. I can't believe the vast majority of people know that the things we are doing are harming the environment in large ways, yet still there is no action being taken to prevent these things. People need to be educated on these main pollution rates so that they can take charge in working to stop this problem. Secondly, I found that when you brought up food waste as a huge problem in America to be extremely true. The buffet system in which you mentioned is flawed at its core. Many people waste food for the reasons you stated, either they do not like what they've taken or the take too much. This is a problem many Americans do not seem to care about, however food think about how many people think the food they waste does not matter. Everyone in the U.S. has surely wasted food at some point or other in their life times and this problem needs to have a solution, whether it is the end of buffet style food services or moderating how much food people can take restrictions must be put into place and or laws should be made to curb this problem.

After reading these 25 top solutions, I learned a lot about how to save our planet from climate crisis. From my perspective, it is important to stop climate change as soon as possible for both personally and globally as a whole. What surprised me the most is that the top one solution is about refrigerant management. I used to think the most important one is renewable energy. Chemical products released caused by human activities are most devastating. For personally, it is essential to use less air conditioners in our daily lives. For the global as a whole, it is crucial to find an effective replacement of HFCs with less emissions of detrimental gases. Besides, it is also important to waste less food and try to consume plant-rich diet in our daily lives. These actions can cut the emission of carbon dioxide in a large amount and these are what we can do to protect our planet as normal people. For the government and scientists, it is important to find more renewable resources to support our life.
        <br><br>
As human beings, we are always focusing on economic value that we can bring for ourselves. However, we often ignore the side effects of economic development. After the economic growth, we need to pay even more to protect our planet. Because climate change is a long-lasting effect, it would be better to take an action from now on. It is never too late to take an action. We should find a balance way to promote our economic development and protect the environment simultaneously.

After reading through the solutions given by Project Drawdown, I became very optimistic about our future of battling against climate change.  Although I know that it will still be a struggle, the diversity of things we can do to combat the climate crisis gives me hope.  For example, if fossil fuel industries are able to combat and out-compete solar power energy companies, there will likely be upcoming geothermal companies to join the competition and to push for a sustainable and renewable source of energy.  Not only that, but there are also developments with wind turbines to compete in the industry involving providing electricity.  Not only can they compete to bring down the amount of fossil fuels used, but they can also transition the economy from non-renewable to a renewable energy source so the economy is remained unharmed.  The diversity of solutions also includes education, family planning, agriculture, diet, housing technology, and protecting and regenerating habitats.  With such a wide range of solutions, we're bound to successfully carry out at least some of them, and Project Drawdown showed optimistic results that each solution can bring.  I think the solutions given by Project Drawdown will be a great template for the future of sustainability.




</p><hr>


<p>

First off, I was very excited to explore Project Drawdown. I feel like the past five weeks have been building up to this moment: a list of possible solutions. It is encouraging that while some of the solutions emphasize the collective, others are changes that can be made on a personal level. This is in line with a recurring theme in the class when it comes to addressing the climate crisis: the personal is important but so is larger scale activism.

        <br><br>

Another reason I really liked Project Drawdown was because it ranked the relative impact that each solution could bring. In fact, the top 25 solutions were rather surprising. It’s baffling to me that innovations like the electric vehicle, solar energy, and wind turbines are hailed as the be-all and end-all of the climate crisis but they’re not even amongst the top 25 solutions. I agree with Ken, I think it probably has something to do with the fact that the most effective solutions are not seen as glamorous. In fact, I’ve noticed that solutions involving cutting back on certain facets of our existing lifestyles — rampant consumerism, large houses, owning and driving a vehicle, eating whatever we want — are not encouraged as much because they consist of cutting back. Whereas solutions that would involve adding to our lifestyle — buying an electric vehicle, installing solar panels — are much more widely accepted. I think this says a lot about the current cultural climate of our society. 

        <br><br>

Moreover, it is encouraging but simultaneously disheartening to see that educating women and children is the number #6 solution for addressing the climate crisis. Encouraging because educating women and children is a broad cultural and social issue of utmost importance and following through could have so many positive ramifications even beyond mitigating the climate crisis. I say it’s also disheartening because women have been fighting for the right to education and having control over their own bodies for centuries and yet it is still such a prevalent issue to the point where it is in the top 10 list of things that need to be done to save our planet. I would also like to emphasize that I really appreciated Ken saying that the problem and the responsibility does not lie with the women but instead with the institutions that control and oppress them.

Actually wind turbines are amongst the top 25 approaches, I made a comment about that, here is how I wrote: Wind energy is at a very important place for reducing global warming. And we can tell from the rankings that both onshore and offshore wind turbines are within the first 25 approaches. Especially onshore wind, it is in the second place of all. It has a lot of advantages, costs comparably low while maintaining high performance, and the costs are continues to fall as new technology develops. It also has no fuel costs, no pollution, only take small footprints, and easy to build. For offshore wind, growing from 0.1 percent to 4 percent could avoid 14.1 gigatons of emissions, that's an astonishing amount. Moreover, wind turbines can deliver trillions of net savings over three decades of operation. Lastly, I want to say that besides wind turbines the other things on the rankings also are the ones we heard so many times before and are pretty familiar with, we know the solutions now, it is time to put in actions.

This week's reading is what I have been looking forward to since this class started. I knew the state of climate change was horrible but the first few weeks of class were pretty pessimistic. There was mostly talk about the problem but nothing yet of solutions. 
        <br><br>
With that being said this reading gave many solutions that we can implement in our daily lives now. The one that I would say spoke to me the most was that of the largely plant-based diet. I know from firsthand experience that a lot of people will say that they won't do it because their lifestyle won't allow it whether it be fast food is cheap and plentiful, or you eat what your family makes (coming from a Mexican household I know that most foods require meat), or the gym enthusiasts will complain about not getting enough protein, etc. But implementing a largely plant-based diet doesn't mean you have to go completely vegan or vegetarian. It just means you consume less meat/poultry than before and replace those foods with other alternatives such as lentils, beans, spinach, broccoli, etc. 
        <br><br>
As a person who wants to go into medicine, I have spent time shadowing with an internal medicine physician. The one thing he stressed to me was that most of the people he sees come into his practice come for a reason that involves what they put into their bodies. Most patients who came in were diabetic or on the verge of having diabetes. As the reading stated “ $1 trillion in annual health-care costs & lost productivity.” The number one way to prevent illness is to adopt a healthy lifestyle and nourish your body with the foods you eat. This will improve your long term health and save you a lot of future trips to the doctor. And it is important to remember everything is good in moderation so one does not have to completely cut out food from their diets, just consuming less will drastically improve your personal health and be better for the climate.

I definitely agree with the pessimism aspect of the class in the beginning. We kept hearing how global green house emissions have been increasing through consumption of goods, transportation, and the state of environmental catastrophe via climate change, but we barely touched the surface on solutions. I think that the structure of the class works well because coming up with solutions is simply not enough. We have to identify the problems as accurately we can so that we fully understand the components that said problem has. This is why Ken highlighted electric cars. It's not just the carbon emissions  released from driving that is the problem, but the factories producing them, shipping them, and false eco-friendly mentalities that are also the problem. I also thought about this when looking at Project Draw-down's solutions. These don't only tell X amount of things to combat climate change, but how X solution--like changing refrigerant--will impact us economically, environmentally, and solution(s) we can do. Most people know that recycling is good for the environment or biking to school reduces greenhouse emissions, but they don't know the exact details or how much of an impact these seemingly small solutions have. There is power in knowledge!


<br><hr>
I agree with the points you have made. People always seem to find an excuse as to why they can't change their diet and I understand some of the reasons include ethnicity. But the fact is, we all have to do our part to overcome this climate crisis. And I understand that majority of the people simply do not want to be told what to do, when it's their lives but what's frustrating is that they fail to understand the importance of simply eating more greens. Like okay, if you don't want to stop driving your car then can you at least consume less meat? It's not that hard, and frankly you shouldn't be eating all that meat in the first place. 
        <br><br>
For me, I knew it was going to be hard to stop eating meat (being from a Mexican heritage) and I'm still not completely done eating meat. But I know being away from home right now, and having the salad bar in the dinning commons, has allowed me to take a huge step away from meat compared to the dishes my mom makes at home. But now that I consume more spinach and fruit, when I go home I find myself craving the greens because my body has gotten use to it and it begins to feel somewhat gross if I consume meat. 
        <br><br>
Overall, I'm happy that we are finally receiving some solutions to the climate crisis and I sincerely hope we will all do our part within our personal lives and register to vote!



<br><hr>

I agree with Andrew’s comment. I also was looking forward to this part of the class, where we get answers on how to fix things instead of learning about the problems on top of problems that are going on. 
        <br><br>
I, too, come from a Mexican household that makes switching to a plant based diet quite complicated. I am still in the process of trying to eat less meat and switch to healthier alternatives, knowing it will not only benefit me, but benefit the planet to some extent. As for the other 24 things that were at the top of the list, some were really surprising to me. I would’ve never even thought half of them were problems. For example, the refrigerant management that was at the very top of the list. It’s pretty cool learning about the things that can be replaced in order to reduce global warming. It opens my mind up to all the other things that can be improved to reduce global carbon emissions.

I found this week's reading and this video to be very interesting. There were many things on Project Drawdown that I would have never thought would have as great of an impact as they do, like  refrigerant management. I thought it was interesting, but not surprising, that most of the top solutions had nothing to do with technology, which is often stressed in our culture, but instead had everything to do with culture and lifestyle. At first I wondered why the top solutions are rarely talked about, and why all the focus is on technology, but then I realized that the changes in lifestyle and culture would not really make any money for anyone. For technology, companies like Toyota and Tesla make unimaginable amounts of money off of products, which is at least partially due to their advertising as being clean and environmentally-friendly. While they may be less harmful than other products, they are still not as helpful to the environment as refrigerant management. Refrigerant management, however, does not really make any big companies any profit, so we do not hear about. Unfortunately, the majority of what we hear and see is meant to help companies with money make even more money, and very little is meant to help fight the climate crisis, or help anyone or anything in general, other than big money companies.  We as a society need to start valuing scientific rhetoric more than consumerist rhetoric in order to help ourselves and others.

Before I took this class, I knew very little about global warming and how we could protect our environment to reduce greenhouse gases. Most of the things I knew were surface level like driving less and switching to a plant-based diet. After five weeks of being in his class and after reading the first 25 solutions of project drawdown there is definitely something we can all do to decrease emission gases. Never did I know that so many factors contribute to the release of greenhouse gases like the waste of food, the cement industry and many more. However here we are provided by many solutions that will greatly help lower our CO2 production by a lot. Many of the mentioned solutions can be started right now and we don't have to wait for the government to begin forming policies. For example, we can start by eating healthier, we don't necessarily have to switch right away to a plant-rich diet but eating less and less meat every week will help make a difference. Reducing our food waste is essential and we the consumers can help contribute to this by being conscious of our food portions and only getting or buying what we will be eating. As mentioned the food we waste is responsible for roughly 8% of global emission including vegetation from farms going bad, poor storage or transportation so we should at least do the minimum and waste less food whenever possible. These small changes and like many more I did not mention here take little effort to do, so I don't see why we can't all make a few changes in our daily lives to make at least a little difference in our suffering environment.

After finishing this week’s reading, I feel like the blueprint of resolving the climate crisis in the future has become very clear to me. It’s an inspiring and optimistic list of solutions addressing the problem of the climate crisis, which comprehensively showcases several ways for humans to step forward on the recovering process. In terms of the total amount of atmospheric carbon-dioxide reduction, I was shocked that the refrigerant management is ranked #1 upon the whole list. From this topic, I learned that 90% of the refrigerant emission comes from the end of devices’ lives, which indicates that it emits a lot of greenhouse gases during the disposal of those abandoned devices. I think that it will be really helpful and influential to the whole page if everybody is going to select refrigerants that are eco-friendly. 
        <br><br>


In the video introducing the reading, one point that Ken made was extremely insightful that advancing the education should be considered as our top priority now because that is the most effective way to spread all of these project solutions and increase our awareness. I still remember one term that Ken mentioned in his previous mini-lecture: Intergenerational Education. This could be related to the point here since it’s also important to specify the term of “Education” and it’s our responsibility to teach our parents and grandparents the latest knowledge.

        <br><br>

Overall, this reading is my favorite one so far and it offers me a lot of brand-new information that I’ve never heard of. I believe that constantly publishing this kind of readings is definitely going to make a huge impact on the world.

I really liked how simple the summaries were to read, and compared to some of the other readings in this class made me feel a little hopeful towards the future, and made me feel like there is actually a chance to fix the climate crisis.  It is still a little concerning that even though these all seem like attainable goals, nothing has been done to try and implement them.  I think that much of the world is still operating in a very selfish way, but hopefully, my generation will be able to start making a change. 

        <br><br>

The first thing that stood out to me when I started reading the summaries was that refrigerant management was the number one solution, and reduced total atmospheric co2 by 89.74%, but the more I thought about it, the more it made sense.  Pretty much every house has a fridge and air conditioner (if you live in even a remotely warm area), and at least one, if not both, will be running 24/7.  The next thing that stood out to me was how easy some of the solutions were to start integrating into everyday life.  The #3 solution, reducing food waste, is definitely something that needs to be fixed on a global scale, but trying to waste less and even start composting in your everyday life could make a big impact if everyone makes a conscious effort.  I also think that adopting a plant-rich diet is something that everyone should try, as it will also be beneficial for your health.  Even if you aren't able to go completely meatless, being pescatarian or vegetarian is a step in a good direction, as was pointed out in the summary.  As I was going down the list, I was very surprised by some of the solutions.  For example, I didn't know that peatlands can store twice the amount of carbon that forests do, even though they only cover 3% of the planet.  I hope that cities can start implementing some of these green solutions, like rooftop solar and refrigerant management, and that we can also start optimizing our land use.  I thought the silvopasture solution was super interesting, and a really good step in the right direction for better management of greenhouse gas emissions.  Overall, I think slowly implementing these solutions will help our planet move forward in a more eco-conscious and sustainable direction.

In reading this list, most of what I had hypothesized about the movement to stop climate change has been validated. The capitalistic consumer market in the United States (as well as its strong influence on the behaviors and practices of those around the world) has bred an unsustainable market though which we have no choice but to exist. Most of what we do as a country, from our land management policies, food consumption and waste,and  energy use, etc,  are done so in the cheapest fashion that provides the producing companies with the largest return on investment. 
        <br><br>


To stand a fighting chance in the fight against rapid climate change, our model of existence will have to be significantly altered. As evidenced by the long list of things we can do to combat climate change effectively, there is no one simple solution that everybody can adopt to ensure a safe future for our planet. Rather, these changes will have to be widespread, various, and systematic. We must reevaluate the entire way our market functions in order to have a hope for restoring the health of our ecosystems and planet. 

        <br><br>

One of the major things aside from a plant based diet that I think we will see being adopted on a widespread level in the near future is renewable energy sources; specifically wind and solar. Several studies conducted outside the parameters of Project Drawdown, including some studies well known and cited by the environmental activism group Sunrise Movement have shown that concentrated use of wind and solar in small areas of the United States have the potential to completely power the entire continental U.S. As stated in several of the summaries on Project Drawdown, the affordability and increased technology in these areas lend themselves to adoption into our mitigation efforts before many of their energy saving counterparts.

In Project Drawdown, I was drawn to the solution of nuclear energy generation. Nuclear is often brought up in the conversation of energy generation and switching to renewable energy as it provides a tremendous upside while also bringing inherent dangers with it. There is a stigma surrounding nuclear energy and for good reason. Even mentioning nuclear energy in topical conversation can lead to images of nuclear bombs, meltdowns, Chernobyl, etc. I'm from San Diego where the San Onofre power plant had been a tenuous situation for the city. It's kind of a landmark where if you drive by it you know you're back in SD, but it was decommissioned in 2013 and soon will be torn down. Therefore, I was largely interested in reading more about nuclear energy even before delving into Project Drawdown's summary of it because it seems like the best last resort option if renewable energy does not spread as much as it wants to. That's why I largely agree with the conclusion made by Drawdown, of it being a "regrets solution." The world may not want to turn to nuclear energy, but if we continue to rely on fossil fuels and other nonrenewable sources, it may regretfully have to.




</p><hr>


<p>
During my reading of the first 25 approaches, the comparitively low ranking of nuclear energy immediately caught my eye. I have always been taught that nuclear is one of the most realistic options to dramatically reduce our use of fossil fuels and is more efficient than other sources of energy such as wind and solar. For this reason, I read the methodology used to assess the role of solar in reducing emissions and discovered several interesting parts of their approach to nuclear that I take issue with. Within the first introduction paragraphs on nuclear, an entire paragraph is devoted to assessing the arguments against nuclear, which included worries about meltdowns and theft of material for illicit purposes. While the naming of the downsides seemed reasonable and a necessary part of such a research project, when compared to how other solutions were presented, I couldn't help but think there may have been bias in how nuclear energy was assessed. For instance, the section on solar does not name the downsides in the same fashion, such as that large solar farms would require land use that would damage ecosystems. While I acknowledge that nuclear is justifiably more controversial, I couldn't help but sense there was some bias that shaped how they studied nuclear power. For instance, politicians who claim to be at the forefront of pushing climate policy, such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both have vowed to phase out nuclear power. The typical reasoning for such a position is general dislike for nuclear energy, not for specific environmental concerns, but due to concerns over proliferation and broad unease toward nuclear weapons. 
        <br><br>
While I am not accusing Project Drawdown of letting such beliefs corrupt the methodology, I think it may have played a role in their assessment of it. The source of my belief is that under their "optimum scenario," nuclear energy begins to be phased out in 2023 and is reduced to zero by 2050. This part of their methodology seems to be why the impact of using nuclear energy to replace other energy sources appears to be smaller in this study than in other assessments of nuclear's potential. I think that suggesting nuclear energy use should peak in 2023 is partially motivated by political biases against nuclear and fails to fully realize its potential for helping to reduce emissions.

Ken!!! This is uplifting!!! Thank you. It only took five weeks of depressing readings and films. We made it.
        <br><br>
What I love about this website is how manageable they make fixing the climate crisis feels. I read these solutions and I think, We can do this. It reads like one of those self care threads on Twitter, except it’s for a planet. Plus, like those self-care threads, everyone loves reading them, but not actually trying any of them! These solutions are all feasible, and if as a society we decided we were ready to implement them, we really are capable of all of these. The problem is that a lot of these solutions have been doable for a while now, and we have made little to no progress on them. So what will it take to start?
         <br><br>
Ultimately, this reading made me a little concerned, but mostly hopeful. We haven’t put our minds to achieving these solutions yet. But all it takes is for people in power to lead the charge in making these ideas reality. World governments can come together again to find another solution for refrigerant management. Nations can help poorer nations fund educating girls. Providing family planning is so, so feasible. Now that this new generation that is voting, we must take advantage of our ability to vote to make sure people in office advance us towards these goals.

I agree with you since these solutions really offer us a beam of hope in contrary to the pessimistic readings before. Not only are these solutions feasible, but they can be done quite easily as long as we really want to change. People always tend to ignore such solutions because they do not sound like a big deal. They may think if it is so easy to save the world, then why is  no one doing it? People would have imagined that the planet-saving solutions are so significant that no one could think of it until a brilliant savior finally figures that out and tell the whole world that we can save our planet now. The truth is, in contrast to what they think, that such simple solutions do work, and they work significantly well. We have to confront the truth. People rejecting to do so are probably ashamed of admitting that they can’t even figure out these things. They feel like its an acknowledgement to their ignorance. However, if we fail to practice these simple solutions, then we are indeed ignorant.


<br><Hr>
1000%, It was sooo refreshing reading through this. The analogy you made to self care threads is so damn true! We can definitely implement these methods, but it’s like okay so where is the effort? There’s always the argument of cost or loss of profits. Some of these people just straight up don’t want to do it (such as eating less red meat). Like you pointed out though, these are definitely something that can be done. It makes me think about that time in lecture where Ken emphasized that the government is spending billions on damages caused by the effects of climate change, yet they argue that we can’t invest in eco-friendly alternatives because it would cost too much.
         <br><br>


Voting and spreading awareness is so beneficial.  There’s definitely a lot that we can do individually, I mean eating a plant-based diet is pretty high in ranking for example. However, many of these we really need the support of the government to implement. We have to get people in office who actually care about our planet and understand the severity of not taking action against climate change. I feel like, not only would having someone in office that actually implements things such as refrigerant management or solar energy be directly impactful, but it would indirectly make people encouraged to change their lifestyle. I think it’s also important for people to understand what laws and regulations are being passed in their own cities and/or counties. Voting for solutions in local areas helps too! I’m excited for our generation to vote and I think I’m finally beginning to feel more optimistic about helping the planet.

This was one of the easiest and most motivating readings that we’ve had so far in that there’s a list format, with very clear ways displayed out there for us, of 80 different solutions. That’s incredible. Look no further, for even though we only examine the first 25, these alone cover such a wide range of ways to help. I especially appreciated that it counted in the effects and benefits of educating girls as its own separate topic as I truly do stand on the side that education on these matters and in general makes a huge impact on its own. There are a good handful of these that I have known before as solutions, and a good handful that I was surprised about, especially in terms of ranking. The fact that refrigerant management was actually ranked first place in terms of solutions was surprising, as it isn’t the first thing that comes in my mind particularly as opposed to other tactics. Having taken AP Environmental Science before, I have a fair amount of knowledge about the harmful things and the depletion of the ozone from these harmful chemicals, but this read goes into a perfect amount of depth with statistics to back up how this will all benefit in numbers. Many times in this course, Professor Hiltner has brought up that many of us his students have come to him asking for solutions. This is just the answer for them. As I scroll through these comments, I am not alone seeing so many others like myself surprised to see refrigerants to be such a harmful and important action to take. My takeaway from that particular method, is that it is of such high importance partially due to that it is such a dangerous thing and difficult as well to get rid of or or properly reuse- similar to battery disposal, which must be done correctly to prevent harm. Many of these suggestions happen at the bigger level, which would be harder for us each to act upon without an organization or such, but there are still things in here that are accessible for us like clean cookstoves, rooftop solar, reduced food waste, plant-rich diet, family planning, and electric vehicles. Personally, I felt moved by the idea of educating girls and programs that strive to improve this. This itself could be my own goal later down the road, as my own way of contributing back, adding to the solution, making things better. Going through each of the first 25 was a heavy load on numbers, but they all come down to the same thing more or less, which is that they each offer a solution of some sort to help improve our current situations and draw down our climate footprint impacts.

I felt the same way after reading the top 25 solutions to climate change. It’s definitely comforting to know that there are solid measures that we can take to reduce our carbon emissions and save our planet. As you and many others mentioned, it’s a little surprising that refrigerators and air conditioners are some of the biggest contributors to warming the earth’s atmosphere. But if you think about it, it makes sense. I remember when I was younger, the portable AC unit I have at home used to scare me because of how loud it would get when it got really hot. I can only imagine how much energy is put into that small unit that’s supposed to be able to cool down our entire house when it’s above 100 degrees Fahrenheit outside.
         <br><br>


As for the rest of the solutions, I found it surprising that managed grazing made it to the top 25. I didn’t realize how big of an impact it has on carbon and methane emissions, but Project Drawdown made it clear how grazing affects soil health, carbon sequestration, water retention, and forage productivity. The rest sounded somewhat familiar, though - from changing our diets to using solar farms to changing the way we work with soil when growing our food.
         <br><br>


Overall, although this reading is somewhat statistic-heavy, I found it helpful to see what kind of results we could expect 30 years later if we followed their suggestions as well as how much we need to spend to make them possible. I think all of us can find something in this list of solutions that we can apply to our own lives, and that makes the future look promising for us.

<br><hr>

I felt the same way. It was really nice to finally have a motivating read instead of one that made me worried about my daily habit's impact on the earth. Although  those are useful and help me change my behaviors, it was nice to do this reading because it gave us so many concrete options to help save the planet and decrease our carbon footprint. I thought it was really interesting to learn about the new ways to generate energy, like geothermal,  concentrated solar, and wind turbines. I found it really motivating to know how useful these new manners of energy generation can be and how plentiful the resources needed to generate them are, as well as how little, if any, carbon footprint they supply. I also think the social issues they addressed, like increasing education, contraceptive access, and family planning to women around the world was interesting and would help solve many issues outside of environmental ones as well- it would help increase female independence, opportunities for women, and open up many career/life-path opportunities for women who otherwise might not have the access to these resources.

Finally reaching the point of the class where we discuss solutions to the climate crisis is such a relief for me as well. What enthused me about reading Project Drawdown was how many of the solution benefited both human and animal welfare. It's important to remind naysayers that the solutions to the climate crisis have huge leaps and bounds for people's standard of living around the world: things like family planning and equal education, clean energy as a right, and even clean burning stoves to improve indoor air quality. The emphasis on the plant-based diet reduces the number of animals we bring onto this planet for exploitation, and the need to shift to better methods of grazing and land use will benefit the livestock we still keep.

Overall, Project Drawdown was so heartening to read because it listed practical solutions that we could implement at any time, even today. Like Ken mentions in lectures and his videos, all we need to do to fix the climate crisis is to support people who are implementing these solutions.

Linda I agree with many of the points you make about the readings. Despite this reading being a lot easier than most, it was probably one of, if not the most, important reading we’ve done yet. 

         <br><br>

Recently, the readings and films have been touching on some more meaningful changes we can make on an individual as well as, as a collective. However, these more meaningful changes are coming with sacrifice. Like Ken says it is easy to unplug your phone charger, or use LED light bulbs, but what does it really mean when driving a car for one second will use up more energy. Ken’s point about how even though HFC use is the number one change we can do as a collective, it doesn’t get much press, is a very important one. I consider myself by most metrics to be pretty educated about climate change issues, and I had no idea that HFC’s had such a big impact. Again, reading the 25 proposed solutions re emphasizes that we need to reexamine our relationship with food. 2 of the top 5 things we can do as a collective directly relate to food use and food waste, additionally the fifth thing-- tropical rainforest conservation-- is also tangentially related as one of the primary reasons tropical rainforests like the amazon are being cleared is for agricultural land. It is interesting to see that Onshore wind turbines are number two on the list. I wonder if companies like Tesla will expand into that sector, most likely not … but one can hope. On a political level, the net cost for an increase in Wind Turbine production worries me. That’s 1.25 trillion dollars to help remedy this issue. I understand that our country has spent more on far less important things, i.e the recent conflicts in the middle east, but that is still a significant chunk of money for a country already massively in debt. Anyway, these readings give us something to think about before our upcoming election.


<br><hr>


I agree with a lot of what you said.  In particular, I believe it is important to focus on the HFC's as that is a relatively easy change that will cause a decent impact.  Furthermore, this change could be relatively immediate.  
         <br><br>


I also enjoyed having a reading that focused on proactive  measures rather than another reading about the problem.  I feel at this point we all are aware of the greater issue and just need guidance for things we can do to help.  I found it particularly interesting how much damage is caused by our overindulgence with food.  Though those changes would not be the easiest, it is also not as difficult as I originally thought.  

         <br><br>

Regarding the more ambitious items on Drawdown (i.e. Nuclear Power and Wind Turbines), I believe they are both necessary and viable actions.  Even though something such as nuclear power has its disadvantages, it is significantly better than current options.  And other than startup and maintenance costs, wind power is one of the friendliest options.


<br><hr>


Just like you and many others who have commented I was also surprised that refrigerants were number one. I had never even thought of this as a possible issue, I have heard of other methods like solar, wind, and nuclear energy to combat climate change, but refrigerant management was not one. There were also many other ideas here that I enjoyed and never thought of, specifically the ones about rebuilding, protecting, and creating new carbon sinks in land where there used to be farms or forest. It amazed me that there is 950 million to 1.1 billion acres of deserted land. Image the possibilities, we could create a whole new forest, it would take time, but not only would it be use full as a carbon sink, it would also create new ecosystems and support more wildlife. I find these ideas the most interesting because of my love for nature, I do hope that this move to create forests in deserted lands is put into action because I think it would be amazing to witness.


<br><hr>
I second your comment post. As mentioned, I also believe that this is one of the easiest and most motivating readings that we've had so far in a list format. The list was direct and had only about 2-3 short paragraphs that are easily understandable and accessible. Although it may seem like the solution list is promising, I find it ironic that there is a list of solutions but we as a society have not yet fully committed to these solutions through practices and actions. However, it is definitely a good start, the 'Project Drawdown' has definitely narrowed the plausible solution for the climate crisis. Like you, I also stand on the side that education on these matters will make a huge impact on  its own. Specifically, Educating girls. I find that idea really promising because in today's society, we need more intellectual women to lead and/or enlighten the minds and decision making of the people for the next generation to come, especially when it comes to dealing with the climate crisis. We are currently having a hard time adjusting to it because we are not accustomed to the practices that we should take in solving this issue. I believe educating girls will surely be beneficial for our society and I could see women guiding humanity in eradicating the climate crisis.

I totally agree with Linda. This week's reading was nice and comprehensible. I also agree that the style of which the solutions were given was nice and I was also surprised when I found out that refrigerant management was the number one solution. I remember learning from previous Environmental Science classes that early refrigerators were bad because of the chemicals that they released, but I always assumed that the problem was fixed since it hasn’t been talked about much recently. I also was pleasantly surprised that they showed the importance of educating girls and offering family planning classes. I remember learning that educating girls helps lower birth rates which is great because on this planet we have an ever-growing population that is becoming harder and harder to feed and find resources to sustain it. I was just happy to see girls being thought about and showing how it is important to educate young girls since even today in many countries girls do not even make it to a middle school education because they are forced to drop out. Upon going through all 25 of the solutions I realized how all of them are super important each and every one of the solutions are and I could see how these were the top 25 solutions that they chose. In his video professor, Hiltner talks about how many people might think that solar panels, wind turbines, and electric cars were more important than some of the other solutions but I feel like all the solutions were ranked correctly by importance. I feel like solar panels and wind turbines are important renewable resources that the United States should turn to, but they should not be thought of the saving grace solutions.

This list was very informative and is a great resource for everyone! After reading it, I immediately sent it to my parents to show them the most important changes we can make to mitigate climate change. I really liked that every change was bundled into a certain sector, and it was crazy to see how many had to do with food. Also, at my first glance, I thought that Ken had been lying to us all along about the most important change to make being about wasting less food and switching to plantbased diet, when I could see that number one on here was refrigeration management. However, this was cleared up in the video when Ken said you had to add the two together which I failed to do.
         <br><br>
I was a little disappointed that we had not talked about refrigeration management very much in class when it is the number one thing while standing alone. I wish I had known more about it before reading this project. Honestly, there were a few topics like this on the project that I really wish we talked more about. I understand that we have been given the most important ones and the ones that we can really take action on, but I would have liked to have been more knowledgeable on the majority of these top 25 changes. I had never heard of silvopasture before, yet it can sequester 5-10x as much carbon as a grazing land with no trees, which I think is a great thing to know about. I would like Ken to go over actions that may be more collective in class so that we can discuss in depth these strategies that we have barely covered.

This was one of the first readings that I actively enjoyed reading from start to finish; everything laid out, from the summaries to the important statistics to the predicted outcomes, was thorough enough but clear to help one understand the extent of each strategy. A lot of the Project Drawdown solutions laid out surprised me in their rankings, like the first one about refrigerators. It struck out to me as to how much just efficiently disposing HFC products could do for the environment and why this effort never gains any traction in the mainstream media. Another odd placement to me was the whole onshore vs off shore wind turbines. Intuitively I would've thought off-shore wind turbines would hold more potential in fighting carbon emissions, so I was thoroughly surprised that onshore wind turbines provide the 2nd most impact against climate change. 
         <br><br>

Reading through the list, it became apparent how much a factor things like food production and consumption play a role in climate change. Just cattle alone would hypothetically contribute to the worlds carbon emissions. Yep that's right! We have come so far in our want for so much food (in this case meat) that COW FARTS are an major player in the release of carbon emissions. Not to mention, we also end up wasting a lot, whether it be in terms of land to produce food, or wasting the food itself. 
         <br><br>

In another comment of mine, i was becoming distraught on how cultural changes, like how we consume food, can be big enough to make that much of a dent in the system. But now I am wondering whether our own changes in the types of food we consume and the amounts can play a role in how companies approach producing the food. An example of how agricultural techniques can be tweaked which was brought to light was of silvopasturing, a great technique that I think farmers here in Santa Barbara can take up with our erratic and often drought like conditions.

I also very much enjoyed this reading. I find that laying down the many aspects in which we can start helping our planet is likely the best way to consumer information regarding this topic, the reading managed to place an emphasis on the importance of every "solution" while educating us on the problem itself. Prior to reading these statistics and summaries on certain topics I would have never correlated the importance of some of these issues to climate change. One of the issues that stood out to me was that of "Educating girls", while I couldn't agree more that all have the right to an education, reading about how addressing this problem can have an overall impact on our planet and of course the lives of those individuals really motivates me and hopefully many others towards wanting to pursue more information and action towards addressing this. 

         <br><br>

Unsurprisingly, "Food Waste" was a top problem adding to the climate crisis. I completely agree with Yousuf, I too believe that our product (food) consumption habits can make a social/cultural impact. Consuming less can lead to the slowing down of the production process and consuming alternative (more environmentally sustainable) products can lead to the price drop via higher demand of other products. I don't think it will ever happen the other way around, because a businesses priority will always be profit, I don't believe corps. to ever want to reduce they're production process let alone, produce less "efficiently" by making less. 

         <br><br>

Overall, this week's reading held a positive tone as I didn't feel helpless and instead directed towards specific issues I can start taking more seriously if I want to make a real impact. I will definitely be sharing this site with people.

After reading through the first twenty five solutions on the Project Drawdown website it made me much more hopeful for the future of this planet than the previous readings of the first five weeks of the quarter. I understand that the road to recovery of the mass destruction we as humans have performed on this planet is long but I strongly believe that these solutions will have a large impact and are tangible to achieve within our lifetimes as young adults. Many of the solutions are scheduled to go into effect within the next fifty years such as, refrigerator management and reduced food waste. Although many politicians, including the president, would love to argue that these energy and resource saving solutions expend too much money, real scientists and economics have calculated that solutions like transitioning to rooftop solar power will cost the country $450.14 billion but save us $3476.53 billion. The savings is coincidentally the portion that is many times left out of the argument even though it surpasses the cost of the project upwards of 750%. This goes to show that we must end this period of American ignorance and educate ourselves about current issues through adequate research of educational academic articles and such and not rely on what uneducated politicians tell us. These corrupted people and organizations will only tell you what they want you to hear for their own selfish profit. We must save this planet on our own accord through small actions that provide for a larger impactful global project like limiting foodwaste, providing better sex education for teens and young adults, and consuming less meat products. Small steps for one human that contribute to a huge leap for humankind.

I found this list of solutions very interesting. There are some things on that list that will help very little, but they can still provide some hope. This list really provided information that helped me with my disbelief that somethings don’t help as much as you think they would because of what you have been told. In the transportation sector, each of the solutions have CO2 equivalent reduced projections of less than 25 gigatons. Most of the solutions in the transportation are under 10 gigatons. I never realized how much reducing food waste could actually reduce CO2 emissions. The fact that reducing food waste has a projected CO2 reduction of 87.45 gigatons while transportation is so much less blows my mind. Health and education also surprised me by having a projected CO2 reduction of 85.42 gigatons. What didn’t surprise me however was that plant-rich diets could reduce CO2 emissions by a lot.

I like how this week’s reading is so approachable to anyone, and offers what Ken calls a “roadmap” to what one can do regarding the climate crisis. One of the interesting bits I found pretty surprising and funny was how Lego installed 32 wind turbines in Liverpool, a toy company out of everything. It’s a bit contradictory because even though I loved Legos as a kid, it’s just plastic in the end, adding to the 310 million tons of plastic produced each year. One of the proposals that I think is vitally important is the restoration of farmlands. Consumption is ravaging through our earth to the point where we have occupied so much land for farming to keep up with demand, that once the farmland has been used for what it’s given, farmers walk away in the end. Overall, Project Drawdown is a great execution in the manner it lists its approaches, organizes them by categories, but most of all is an easy and interesting read for anyone willing to do their part.

This week’s reading felt like a breath of fresh air; although it’s still worrisome to see the potential dangers of the climate crisis, Project Drawdown offered possible solutions, instead of just dwelling in the constant (and future) state of our planet. Given that most of the other readings assigned in this class were either pessimistic or critical of our population in our impact on the climate, I appreciated that this list allowed the reader to think more optimistically. While reading through the extensive list of solutions and their respective positive impacts on the environment, I found myself feeling hopeful that there’s still something we, as a global population, can do to improve the state of our climate. I understand that this is an extremely challenging and time-sensitive situation, but it feels better knowing that there are specific large-scale changes we can make to actually do something, rather than dwelling in our climate’s downfall and destruction.
         <br><br>

Project Drawdown was insightful and informative, and I felt like it provided me with a good foundation on the best steps to take toward bettering our planet. As Ken mentioned in his video, people have wanted a formulated plan and well-thought steps to achieve the goal of an improved climate, and I think that this list was perfect. In regards to the climate crisis, I believe that a formulated plan of action and change is critical. Without a proper path in mind, our actions may not add up the way we had intended and we may be focusing on the “wrong” things to improve. This list gives us no excuses for inaction; people claimed they needed detailed instruction on avoiding climate disaster, so now that it exists, our action must start now.

Yes! This week's reading left me feeling a little bit relieved, and also a bit excited for the future of sustainability. While it is still scary to see the degree to which we are ravaging the planet and its resources, it is nice to finally have some sort of "road map" with possible solutions and implementations that could have drastic impacts on our carbon output. Additionally, the top 25 solutions seemed feasible and nothing entirely out of reach. While it certainly is no easy task, it feels better knowing there are still viable options. 

         <br><br>

Project Drawdown described in detail the most important things that must be done in order to reduce global carbon emissions. Reading through several of them, I found the tropical staple trees to be quite interesting and completely sensible. I've always been infatuated with trees (I have an instagram devoted to cool trees I see), and I'm just imagining if we converted millions of acres of grazing areas and cattle farming into forests filled with tropical staple trees. That'd be super cool. I'm upset that our culture has become so accustomed to processed products, all wile utilizing plants straight from the ground is so much more environmentally feasible and entirely better for your health and well-being.

I'm interested in how each solution lists the amount of CO2 it could reduce in gigatons. I understand that a gigaton is a very large amount, but I'd like to know how many gigatons of CO2 have to be reduced in total in order to prevent further catastrophe and eventually start to work towards net zero emissions. Is it hundreds? Thousands? I just think it would help readers realize how much of an impact each of these solutions actually makes towards an end goal.
         <br><br>
I found the summary to be really cool. As Ken mentioned in the lecture, we don't ever talk about the top solution of refrigerant management and until reading, I didn't even know it was a topic of interest. I know that we concentrate a lot on our personal stake in the climate crisis and how to decrease our carbon footprint, but I would like it if Ken would talk to us in lecture about this. I'm surprised that in a climate crisis lecture, the top solution in this plan has never really come up. I don't know anything about refrigerants or the science behind the harm they cause, but I would like to.
         <br><br>
I think the thing that upset me the most while reading was seeing how much of global emissions is a result of Americans and other first world countries rejecting foods because they aren't aesthetically pleasing enough. We have platonic ideals of what our vegetables and other foods are supposed to look like and if they don't meet that standard, we often see the food item as inedible. In reality, it's just as good. Picking carrots shouldn't be like picking a boyfriend, it doesn't have to be good looking to you. Unlike fossil fuels, which are our main power source, this problem is around for literally no reason aside from people being petty.

“Project Drawdown” is by far my favorite reading that we have done so far. I loved the format of the article and how concise and interesting the categories are. This week’s reading excited me and made me feel more optimistic because it gave the readers a realistic list of actions that we can take as a collective to make a change. Of all the categories of solutions, the two that I found the most interesting focused on a plant rich diet and temperate forests.
         <br><br>
The section that focuses on the plant rich diet really made me think about how much a plant based diet can help reduce emissions to the planet. The author gave really good reasons for switching to a more plant rich diet and demonstrates to the reader that meat centered diets impact around 5% of global emissions and regular emissions can be reduced by switching to a vegan diet by 70% and by switching to a vegetarian diet by 63%. Not only can a plant based diet benefit the reduction of emissions, it can also help reduce chronic diseases and health problems. The article states that around “$1 trillion in annual health care costs and lost productivity would be saved” if people switched from meat centered diets to plant rich diets. I think that this fact really shocked me and made me think about how important it is to know the consequences of our actions and the benefits to both the planet and individual health if we switch to plant based diets.
         <br><br>
The other section that I found very informative focuses on temperate forests. I found it interesting that over the course of history, “over 99% of temperate forests have been altered in some way - timbered or converted to agriculture, or disrupted by development.” If these temperate forests could be restored, lands could be used for agriculture and could add to carbon sequestration. I had always known that forest restoration is a large part of reducing carbon emissions, however I had never thought about how much land and additional acres are candidates for restoration (in fact 1.4 billion acres are eligible).  Although forest restoration and regaining “ecological integrity” could take many centuries and would take lots of money, the benefits could help reduce carbon emissions.

Personally, I thought the Silvopasture section was the most intriguing. I hadn't thought of this as a solution to excessive agriculture, yet it makes so much sense. With the presence of trees in a pasture, the carbon and methane cows produce is counteracted by the oxygen produced by trees. Also, the trees would produce another source of income for the farmers if they chose trees that produced nuts or fruit. This is a reasonable option for the agriculture problem, because it still allows meat to be accessible yet decreases the carbon and methane output.

“Project Rundown” was also one of my favorite readings of the class. I think it mainly has to do with how comprehensive the solutions are and knowing that these solutions are options to begin with. I think that many of us do not actually know that there are actual solutions to some issues that enable the climate crisis. For example, like professor Ken mentioned, refrigerator management isn’t talked about in the media and electric cars are though refrigerator management would lessen carbon emissions way more than electric cars would. I think a lot of this has to do with the way industries operate and how several solutions are not financially beneficial in the short run for corporations. For example, food production is one of the largest emitters of carbon dioxide, at number 3 on the list. A lot of food waste is generated in first world countries, but it is perhaps more due to the way that food is produced by corporations, it is more profitable to waste food than be environmentally sustainable in its production. In the readings, it states that, ‘A third of the food raised or prepared does not make it from farm or factory to fork.” This is a significant amount that not consumers, but rather corporations are responsible for. 
         <br><br>
One of the solutions that I found interesting is land usage. It took up a significant part of the solutions. People do not sustainably use the land. For example, some lands have been used up to the point where it cannot be used anymore for agriculture. I thought intercropping was an interesting solution. I feel that again as mentioned, it is probably less profitable in the short run to intercrop instead of exploit mass land for food production.
         <br><br>
Professor Ken mentioned something interesting about the climate crisis and individual solutions that I often think about; how much do they compare to collective action? He begins by stating how unplugging your charger for a day equals the same energy to one second of driving. He also stated that though this does mean to not unplug your charger, we should look at collective action. I do agree with this because collective actions would create large and extremely significant solutions to mitigating the climate crisis. This reading supports what Ken says regarding collective action having a large impact on the climate crisis and what we have been learning in class. In the end, the climate crisis is a collective effort.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this article because of the formatting, and how simply it was broken down. It is so much nicer to read a few paragraphs at a time, and have the impact of the topic right next to it, as opposed to reading one giant blob of text with everything intertwined. When it comes to topics like these they are much more effective in communicating their message when you don’t have to read that much.
         <br><br>

The information on the temperate forests was one that I found interesting as well. We had just covered the various biomes in my environmental science class which included temperate rain forests and temperate deciduous forests. I had learned that most of the original forests in North America and in Europe have been destroyed due to logging (such as oak, maple, beech and elm trees) and urbanization. As a result these biomes have been significantly altered, and the animals that depend on them have suffered substantially. But knowing that we can restore them again and to see how many acres actually could be restored gives me hope that they can flourish again. Afforestation could go hand-in-hand with this in creating new forests like these.
         <br><br>

I also thought that the silvopastures were really cool and tied in nicely with “Cowspiracy”. I have never heard of them before, but they seem like a feasible option. Just by increasing the amount of acres adopted for it we could reduce emissions by 31.2 gigatons, and cows could have more shade! Overall I loved every option, learned so many new things, and have more hope about the world implementing these practices.

I totally agree with you, and after reading the first 25 articles, I realized how big we were in reducing emissions. It sounds like nuclear or solar energy is never an illusion. In fact, this is actually a trivial matter in our lives. And doing these things is actually good for us. This means that when you are doing small things and making few changes, you not only benefit greatly from the environment, but you also make yourself better. For example, eating less meat is not only good for the planet, but also much healthier for us and saves a lot of medical expenses. Just like you said, we switched to a plant-based diet to understand the consequences of our actions and the health of the planet and individuals How important the benefits are. I really enjoy reading these lists because they are so simple, so small and so helpful. All of us should better understand all these things to reveal the true facts about science and participate in the fight to save our world.

This week’s reading had me very surprised and somewhat floored. Never would I imagine half the things on the list to be on there, let alone be in the top 25. This further proved to me that there is a lot more to the climate crisis than what is fed to us through media and elsewhere every day. I was very shocked to see that refrigerant management was #1 in terms of the highest contributor of carbon emissions at 89.74 gigatons if left alone. This was so shocking to me because I never heard anyone speaking of this issue is such a large contributor to the climate crisis and had me wondering about how many of the following solutions would also be just as surprising.
          <br><br>

Another thing that intrigued me was how much of an impact regenerative agriculture can make. Regenerative agriculture can reduce 23.2 gigatons of carbon if put into practice. Before this reading, I didn’t know any of the details of regenerative farming other than the basic definition. The reading really hit it on the nail that without proper soil, we wouldn’t even have food. The solutions offered seem like a small price to pay for such big benefits, such as pest-resistant plants and increased water retention for crops. 
          <br><br>

Just like with regenerative farming, I was glad to hear that one does not need to make drastic changes, and that small changes will be sufficient to make an impact.

I had a very similar response, especially to refrigerant management. I had learned about CFCs and HCFs in high school environmental science, but from what I was taught I thought it was mostly taken care of after the Kyoto Protocol. I didn't realize that there was still a big problem with refrigerants, which goes to show just how little coverage parts of the climate crisis receive, which is such a big issue. There are very few people that really know what contributes to climate change the most, and there's so much ambiguity and misdirection with how to solve the issue and correctly allocate resources. That's what I like about this week's reading--it really breaks down the issue into nice numbers and shows just how much different actions could help the problem. There are so many things that can be done, both personally and globally, that will have such a great impact on the environment, and this reading really put it into perspective, which I liked.

I knew much of the information from Project Drawdown, but was unaware of many of the projected costs of problems and solutions. The threat of refrigerant chemicals has been discussed between myself and my father, but it was in regards to other environmental impacts car refrigerant could have on the environment. In a similar sense, I had heard very little of silvopasture, afforestation, or tree intercropping, but each of these ideas is interesting and gives me an idea of the possibilities the future holds, as well as the need for the right individuals to be placed in charge. Each of these ideas I have thought of, or heard, but did not know how practical they were to averting crisis. In particular, the idea of offshore windfarms is very alluring to me, as it takes very little space, energy that is either the cheapest or very close, and being offshore has less affect on bird populations than onshore farms. I also love regenerative agriculture. It is simply illogical to use chemicals to grow crops, even if they destroy the soil to the point that nothing can grow without more fertilizer, and this idea ties into the idea of conservation agriculture and managed grazing. If one practices conservation agriculture, crop rotations are used to maintain soil rather than pesticides, and the soil is not plowed, preventing soil loss due to looseness.
           <br><br>
Managed grazing prevents the destruction of soil from being compacted by the hooves of livestock, and allows plants to grow part of the time and hold soil in place preventing erosion. I liked how the summary breaks down the costs of each idea, savings or cost associated with each idea. It was also helpful to have the CO2 reduction included, as it demonstrates the positive lasting effect these ideas can have. I found many of Kens topics to be highly interesting and relevant, and the idea of family planning to be an essential point, even in the United States.

KEN, THANK YOU. This is exactly the reading that I was waiting for all year. The previous readings sometimes droned on and on, but this one was perfect. The three to 4 paragraph style with straight to the point solutions was very easy to read and brought realistic solutions with the exact amount in gigatons of CO2 that each solution would save. Each also gave the approximate cost it would take to enact these solutions and how it could be put into place. These articles really opened my eyes to a lot more large scale solutions than I ever even fathomed prior and now I can see realistic steps that we can take.
           <br><br>

Honestly before this reading I felt as though many of our solutions were positive but seemed to be too much to imagine it working, but these points helped me see the actions that could be taken.

I completely agree with you that a concise list of the top effective ways for reducing our carbon emissions is much appreciated. When learning about the climate crisis in class or through videos or readings, it is very simple to get overwhelmed by all of it. It seems there is so much wrong and too much damage done to even begin fixing anything. This wonderfully compiled list paves the way through the chaos that is the climate crisis. It is very useful to see exactly what you can do to make effective change. It is so reassuring to have this list of the actualities. Being exposed to actual, concrete solutions that are, better yet, ranked in order of effectiveness provides hope that there is a way out. 

           <br><br>

After reading this, I can clearly see that the two top issues to direct our attention towards are how we consume food and how we approach woman's education. Reducing food waste and switching to a plant based diet, along with focusing more on family planning and women's education can drastically decrease the damage done to the planet. Being able to see the main things we can direct our attention towards along with a cost and a way to put these plans in place takes me away from a place of uneasiness and uncertainty and fills me with a desire to act.

<br><hr>
I agree with this comment about the ease of the reading. I also ended up watching the film before doing this week’s reading for context. I like how Ken takes common actions that someone might suggest and puts them into perspective. For example--he lets us know that although it might be a good idea to unplug your iphone charger when not using it, just one second of driving will use up the energy you saved. Additionally, I have heard about lightbulb changing as an environmentalist action more times than I can count on my hand--yet it doesn’t even make this list. Plant-based diet was not a surprise having seen "Cowspiracy" and knowing the impact that can make. Reducing food waste is something I have mainly only heard from Ken but making third place on this list was a clear indication of its validity. In fact, I feel that Ken really has spoken on lots of the top contributors that make this list throughout lectures thus far. One that particularly stood out to me was educating girls--Ken talked about that on the first or second day if I am not mistaken. I didn’t realize the lack of education out there since I have been lucky enough to attend schools that cared and taught about access to abortions, birth control, etc. This problem was also reinforced in my interdisciplinary class, “Underserved Medicine” in which Planned Parenthood representatives came in and spoke about their role in the community and goals to reach areas that have yet to be included. Overall, in the past few weeks I have come to realize that a lack of education for women’s healthcare/ access/ etc. is a serious issue that needs lots of attention. Additionally, this reading opened my eyes and gave me direct answers about issues, costs, and what we can do.

While reading the first 25 solutions of Project Drawdown, i was both surprised yet all-too familiar with the ideas and their practical applications. In the top 25 solutions, a majority of solutions were either related to food or electricity generation, with the exception of 2 being categorized as "women and girls" and a small number being in materials or land use. This means that, in most cases, the solution to our problem is either stemmed from food or our power infrastructure. For food, I found many of the solutions to be somewhat common-sense, almost shocking that we even let this be a problem when logically these things make sense. Things like planting more trees, letting the soil replenish its nutrients, and donating unused food instead of disposing of it, all seem like such basic ideas that they should be easy to implement. However, as I've learned from many other things in this course, the idea that we can do them without political and capitalistic interests being threatened seems impossible. One issue in particular for food, which was eating mainly plant based foods, was something that I think should be emphasized. Being a vegetarian myself, and a first year here at UCSB, I rely on the dining halls for a good majority of my meals per week. When i look at the menu however, its nowhere near what it should be for the size of school and the values it claims to represent. Most of the vegetarian options are not healthy, but simply because they dont have meat the school assumes I should eat it. Other than making a salad, the mediocre veggie burgers, or the occasional stir-fry, much of the food being served is just not as healthy as it claims to be. And even when a healthy dish comes along, its lacking in its actual flavor. When half of my options as a vegetarian include french fries, pizza, and pastas, its hard to both try and be healthy yet have a variety in my diet. Why then, would someone who does eat meat, ever try a vegetarian option when its almost inferior in many ways? I think that for such a large institution such as UCSB, there should be a greater emphasis on healthy foods, especially considering that college campus' are areas where people will care about things like the climate crisis and are actively looking for ways to show support.

One of the things that stood out to me on this list was #35 which was Bamboo. Just bamboo. I knew of all of the new bamboo products I had seen coming into the “green”/“sustainable” market, but I have become very untrusting of these labels due to the greenwashing that can be so common. I looked into “Bamboo” on the list and I found out that it is an amazing carbon sink and can grow in soils that have been degraded as well. Even then, though, it can still pose an issue as an invasive species, but I still think that it should become more widely used at least being grown in the places it can be. 
           <br><br>

I was surprised that walkable cities and bike infrastructure were so far down on the list. I feel like most environmental advocates stress having these things and turning away from urban sprawl, but here they were quite low on the list. 
           <br><br>

I was also surprised to see refrigerant management as the #1.
           <br><br>

I think this is a good article because I agree with Ken that we do need to prioritize the changes that we are making to have a bigger impact based on what solutions we need, and this article tells you what needs to change in a very straight forward manner. One thing that may be a problem with this though is that it may induce the mentality that “Oh this is so far down on the list anyways, I might as well take an extra long shower everyday.” While this might be less harmful than eating meat, I don’t think that is how we should look at addressing these issues. I think one of the biggest issues in our society today is environmental awareness and knowing and caring about what we use/eat and where it goes. Just give things a second thought every time you make use of them. This can even be done through gratitude methods, which would boost your mental health as well. Anyways, I think it is important to have a list, especially of the tops of the list, but I don’t think a list should be the only way of approaching it. If anything, a lot of these issues are very interconnected, almost like a web, and our solutions could “kill two birds with one stone” and solve more than one of these issues at once, so its important I think to keep an open mind when looking at the line-up of these issues.

From the solutions provided by Project Drawdown, I learned something I have not thought about before. Even some insignificant changes in lifestyles and habits can impact the environment changes a lot. For example, it mentions the impacts of education on the environement. Education for girls can control birth rates and the global population. It is the influences of culture and thoughts that can change the environment potentially. Instead of finding technological solutions, Project Drawdown gives practical solutions that everyone can apply in real life. 
           <br><br>


To be honest, before I read this article, I thought the solutions would be the same as the solutions I learned from this class so far, but this article inspired me in another way. Climate crisis can be associated with different social issues, such as politics and economy.

I had thought that last week's reading was my favorite so far, but I definitely think Project Drawdown took the crown this week. It's very easy for us students to become pessimistic when we are studying for this class; we are faced with many statistics and disapproving opinions that make it feel like there are obstacles in our way to fight for what we want. However, Project Drawdown eased a lot of my anxieties and worries over the climate crisis. It gave me a little bit of hope! This list of 25 methods contain so much power in their words and make me feel like we can really alleviate these problems.

I think you bring up a really interesting point that the topics we focus on in this class can bring a lot of anxiety to us as students. I agree with you that this reading was one of the better ones because it didn't just focus on the problem, but rather offered solutions. I was actually really shocked to hear how much food waste impacts the environment, making up 8% of our total carbon emissions, but I am actually kind of glad that I can easily make a difference by just wasting less food and even switching to a more plant based diet. I have hope that we can make a significant difference in our carbon emissions if we just spread  the word of what we can do on an individual level to the people around us.


<br><Hr>

I completely agree. Personally, the more I learn about the climate crisis, the more pessimistic I become about it. While I still believe that it is highly unlikely that we would be able to pull all of these methods off globally, I find it reassuring that this list even exists and that there are people out there trying to make this happen. Something really needs to be implemented throughout the world so that we can get to work on this list. I feel like many people may see this reading, or other readings about the climate crisis, and immediately change their lifestyle and do what they can to help. However, the number of people that will actually do this compared to the number of people who will either never learn much about the crisis, or simply continue to ignore it and live their lives normally, is a huge difference. This is why we need to make some sort of global agreement with actual consequences if we are going to make a big enough impact.



<br><Hr>
I agree with Kaila that the article was beneficial to read because it provided solutions that we can all follow. Even if it is only 1/10 of the change that we need, it is a good first step that a lot of people can follow. The change is small but if more people join in, it can create a bigger change like a ripple that influences others to participate. Throughout the first half of the course, we were bombarded with facts on how climate change is destroying the planet. Now we are reading articles that offer solutions to the crisis. Reading the article gives back hope to those who want to see change. The list of solutions that were presented in the article is a good start for all of us to follow and help out in the battle against climate change.

Hello, I completely agree with you that Project Drawdown has really eased the anxiety I was getting from these disheartening statistics and poorly-educated opinions about the climate crisis. Before English 23, I was only aware of some of the problems that cause the climate crisis. Now that I have a grasp of the severity of our collective problem, it’s made me a bit pessimistic for the future. The reality of our situation is rather sad. But, Project Drawdown’s in-depth and straightforward solutions  provide us with hope in the possibility of a better future for our planet and the next generation.




</span></div><hr>

<p>
I think it’s interesting that most of the solutions offered in Project Drawdown are not at all widely-publicized in the media. The popular solutions that we generally see offered do not have nearly as great of an effect as we imagine they do; of course it’s still helpful to turn off lights we’re not using, use more eco-friendly light bulbs, or drive an electric car, but the impacts of these changes are very small compared to the impacts of the lesser-known solutions that this week’s reading went over.
           <br><br>

As many others have stated, I was startled to find that the number 1 solution has to do with refrigerant. I had never even thought of this as a problem before, which just goes to show how little publicized some of these problems are. Why is that? Why is there no coverage on some of these solutions while very small-scale changes like reusable water bottles and metal straws are becoming popular? Maybe it has to do with our wanting to feel as though we’re making an immediate change. It’s easy to focus on the personal things that we do, because we see the action being performed and can feel better about ourselves for helping the climate. With more large-scale solutions, however, we don’t get that same immediate action. Such big changes are harder to enact; they take many people and they take a long time. These large-scale changes, however, are truly the way to make a difference. In order to have a chance to seriously combat climate change, we’re going to need to focus on national and global problems, and the solutions laid out for us to fix them.

Project Drawdown's Summary of Solutions really is a roadmap for how we can start to combat the climate crisis, as Ken mentions. I was first exposed to this list in an introductory ES class at UCSB and I remember being very surprised that refrigerant management ranked as the number one most impactful solution. Prior to reading this list, I never really thought about refrigerants as a primary concern for global warming, yet HFCs (the substitute for CFCs and HCFCs) have 1,000 to 9,000 times greater capacity to warm the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. That's insane! We typically hear of transportation and energy as being the primary areas where we can make meaningful changes, when in reality, cultural changes around food production (and food waste), land-use management, and education of girls and family planning are the primary areas where the most carbon dioxide could be reduced.
           <br><br>

I was unsurprised to hear that reducing food waste and switching to a largely plant-based diet, combined, would have a larger impact than anything else on the list. I work in a restaurant and the amount of food that is wasted on a daily basis is crazy. And to think that’s only one restaurant in one city is incredibly disheartening. I think there is a lot of room for improvement in this area. Starting with greater education and accessibility of composting methods to reduce food waste, both commercially and residentially.
           <br><br>

As far as the education of girls and family planning, I wholeheartedly agree that this is an important task to undertake. We have been raised with this idea in our heads that when we grow up, we’re supposed to get married and have children. We are under the impression that this is just the course of life so we don’t really challenge that idea. Until now. I think this generation is really starting to push and redefine how we identify ourselves. Personally, I always thought I would get married and have children until about 2 years ago when I realized I don’t have to do either of those things and I don’t really want to. I think education around this topic would facilitate in making it seem like less of a radical approach.

Just like everyone else, I found the summary of solutions ranked very clear, concise, and most importantly, convincing. For someone like myself, a regular individual curious to know what I can contribute on my end, I find the summaries and impacts section to be quick and easy to read through. But for people such as climate scientists or politicians who want to know more about the sources and methodology of these studies, Project Drawdown provides more dropdown menus of all the references, technical definitions, and even provides the methodology and results that gave them these numbers and data. Aside from the format and aesthetic to which Project Drawdown displays these solutions, I was surprised as Ken mentioned, that so many of these solutions have to do with agricultural and food production. For someone who lives in an urban environment, I may be ignorant but these changes of food production techniques sound so simple. But then, I think about it and realize that the demand for food from higher-income regions is insane which is where I understand the argument for a plant-rich diet comes in. We can’t support half of these changes in food production techniques if we’re going to continuously demand all of these foods at such outrageous rates that our Western Civilization consumes at. 
           <br><br>

I’m glad that all of these alternative energy solutions are being highlighted, but again without the proper infrastructure to support these changes, it’ll be hard for individuals to request that their electricity come from these clean energy sources. I’m confident that we’re on the way there however. I found it ironic that electric cars were just below the Top 25 cutoff. Lastly, something I found interesting was how Project Drawdown calculated the implementation costs and savings from these solutions. Although most are theoretical, ultimately it goes to show that these solutions would also have such amazing long-term savings despite the expensive upfront costs. This completely refutes people’s arguments that climate change solutions are expensive which I think is the most important aspect to highlight about these solutions .

This week’s reading was very informative and one of my favorites. It was really easy to follow and the data was given to us in a clear understanding. Sometimes it could be hard to follow long texts but the summaries were a great length and easy to retain the information. As I was reading the summaries, I felt somewhat hopeful after reading the solutions presented to us. 
           <br><br>

I was shocked to see that the most effective way to reduce CO2 emissions was refrigerant management. I had little knowledge of how damaging it is when refrigerants are released during their production and disposal. I was surprised to see this ranked as number one just because I don’t come across this topic too much.
           <br><br>

Another topic I liked reading was reduced food waste which was ranked at number 3. I was surprised to see that food waste alone is responsible for 8 percent of global emissions. In order to reduce that percentage, the summary pointed out possible solutions such as improving storage and transport systems, generating public awareness, and changing consumer behavior. I think it's important to create public awareness in order to make a change as a whole. If we start to inform the public more of this issue then it will help lead to more people changing their behavior for the better and will reduce the number of emissions.

Hi Veronica, I agree!! It was really nice to read about things that could actually help the out and it was a very nice shift from all the negative we have had for the most part before. This reading was a lot easier to get through!!
           <br><br>
I also only had little knowledge on refrigerant management before reading this article, so I was very shocked to see it as #1. I also had no idea about peatlands and was shocked to find out how much carbon it stores for the percent of its land area on earth.
           <br><br>
I agree that public awareness is very important, a lot of the things on the list aren't really publicly noted, as Ken mentioned in this intro. It was really interesting to read and learn about so many things that I wouldn't have thought about before.
<br><hr>
I agree with you! This reading was very easy to follow and quite factual, so it made it easy to visualize what can be done to make a full impact on the amount of carbon emissions we have now.  What amazed me was that it often showed that by switching to sustainable energy etc, it actually ends up making the US money in the long run.  If only these were well known facts!
            <br><br>

The thing that most shocked me was that solar was number 25 while refrigerant management is number one.  I feel as though we have not really talked about the harm of air conditioners and refrigerators because of HFCs.  What really astounded me was that if HFCs were to be phased out, 25-78 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions could be avoided.  So what are we waiting for? Why haven’t we been talking about this as much as we should?
            <br><br>

I also think family planning is extremely important, but even so, I think this would be harder to do because it takes time and a slow change of societal or cultural norms in the area.  I think women should be educated, but so should men, because it takes two to make children.  Of course, it is great for women to be educated on how to avoid getting pregnant when they are put in a position to choose whether they want to have sex or not, but sometimes it bothers me that men are not also being invested in being educated on how it is not favorable to have more children and how to use contraceptives as well.

I also enjoyed “Project Drawdown” more than the other assigned readings. I agree the reading was easy to navigate and understand. I like how they not only gave us different solutions but listed by importance. It’s easy to feel a little hopeless in this course, especially after reading our very first assignment, “The Inhabitable Earth.” However, I felt less discouraged as I read more and more solution summaries. Last quarter, I took another GE global warming course which was more on the math/science side, and I remember learning about CFCs/HCFCs and the ozone layer. However, I was not aware that they were still a problem, so I was surprised to see refrigerator management as the number one way to reduce emissions. 
             <br><br>
Another topic I also liked was educating girls, and I appreciate Hiltner emphasizing that the responsibility does not lie with women but the institution. I think I like the idea more of not only saving our environment but also educating girls which can help break the glass ceiling, decrease marrying as children or against their will, lower chances of diseases/infections, and etc. These are so many pros that can come out of simply educating girls, and many easy ways compared to all the other actions to do so.

Project Drawdown offered 80 solutions in various fields that we can work on to improve our environment. Observing the sector column, I find "food" is the most common one: 11 out of 25 are related to food. Reading all of them carefully, I classify them into three types: food waste, plant-rich diet, and agriculture. Reducing food waste is the most important one and ranks top 3 in the list. We waste so much energy and efforts to create uneaten food. This is a complicated problem. But for our students, the biggest contribution we can make to the planet is to only take the food we can finish in the  dining hall. On the turntable, I see many plates with untouched food every day. But I really heard some good news. My friend complained to me that the waiter did not agree to give her two slices of beef at one time, but they did so last quarter. In deed, this is a cool change. Students will get the second beef if they eat the first one and still feel hungry. But if they get two slices at one time, they may feel full after eating the first one and waste the second one. 
             <br><br>
For plant-rich diet, this is a culture issue. To solve it, we may spend a whole century. We should find other alternatives to substitute the meat of livestock as the main provider of protein. When I was in high school, I read an article about eating insects. The meat of insects contains the same amount of protein, but raising them produces far less carbon dioxide. However, eating insects is not the mainstream and many people consider insects as disgusting organisms. As a result, we should spend a lot of time to create a new culture and spread plant-rich diet among the public. 
             <br><br>

For the third part agriculture, I am most interested in topic 14, which is to convert land from annual to perennial. If this idea is implementable, the use of the potential of our land will be maximized. But finding growable perennial plants for every region is really difficult. The whole process of change will take huge eforts and time, but it is worth them.

I thought that this list was really useful in order for society to see the top ways that you can reduce carbon emissions. I felt like a lot of these concepts have been touched on in class, however it was definitely interesting to have each of them explained and how it would help the environment. For me and obvious one was definitely the installment of solar panels on people's roofs. I knew that this was very helpful for the environment, however I was also aware that not a lot of people here in the US have the ability to do this for the cost , as installing solar panels can be very expensive. Something that surprised me when reading was that in countries such as Bangladesh there have been millions of these installed. To me this was very eyeopening, because countries such as Bangladesh do not contribute nearly as much to the emission of greenhouse gases and are doing the most in order to contribute to keep them down. I also was very pleasantly surprised that a country that is considered to be from the third-world was able to install these many rooftop solar panels. I feel like if any other country is able to do this to help the planet, then the US definitely has the ability to too. I believe there should be some type of government implemented program in order to help ensure that houses have solar panels, because in the long run can only benefit our planet.

After reading the 25 solutions in Project Drawdown, I feel that it's such a waste that most of these solutions haven't been implemented already. By looking at the numbers on each part, it seems like the clear choice is to enact these measures and start reducing our carbon emissions. For example, the 10th suggestion, rooftop solars, where it consists of 0.4% of global electricity currently, a growth to 7% can reduce emissions by 24.6 gigatons of CO2. Other methods, such as the simple practice of adopting anew agricultural growing practice and tree intercropping can also drastically reduce the carbon emissions. These methods specifically, seem very feasible, as many new farmers are already implementing these practices. Not only does this produce a greater and better yield, it also preserves the soil for future crops. 
             <br><br>
I am also not surprised that 11/25 solutions are related to land use and food, as agriculture and food is such a basic necessity of human existence. I personally am aware of how much food waste I have committed in the past, but am ever-conscious about it now. However, I am sure that many people do not pay attention their own food waste, and are not educated about the amount of harm it does to the environment. 
             <br><br>
I also think that while these solutions seem easy on paper, it would be harm to mass implement these policies with the current political climate. Democracy works slowly, and to globally implement these policies, some in Third World countries where they have other issues to fight against, would take a long time in accomplishing. Ideally, it is nice to imagine that all these solutions can be implemented can done successfully, however, it would probably be more likely that only some of these solutions and practices are put in place.

 I really appreciated your comment as I felt like these solutions should have been implemented already. Things like Rooftop panels and wind turbines could really make a big difference without much of a trade-off. But reading this also really aspired me in that I could make switches in my own life, like adapting to a Plant-rich diet in which "making the transition to a plant-based diet may be the most effective way an individual can stop climate change." As Ken noted in the video, switching off the phone charger is like bailing off the titanic with a teaspoon, a lot more needs to be done than individual changes- yet they can still be considerably helpful ways we can get involved. I think after reading this article what needs to happen is that people need to get more politically involved. Like you said these solutions seem easy on paper but they're things that governments are never going to allude on their own. Governments do not find climate crisis big enough issues to allocate a trillion dollars too- well at least the American government. People are going to have to start taking action if they want any of these to be implemented. 

             <br><br>

Something that really stuck with me from this video is that what we are being encouraged to do in our lives like switching lightbulbs in our homes are making significantly less impact than they allude too. Why is it we are being told to do things that make such little impact? Maybe if scientists and activists are advocating for bigger changes like reducing food waste, plant-based diets, or even solar panels on our home we would have made a bigger impact by now. Maybe it is the way the message is or isn't getting across.

I think that the reading was very informative as well as interesting, because I got to understand the reasoning behind the solutions that I usually hear about while also learning about new innovative solutions. It was interesting to learn that a third of food raised or prepared doesn't even make it to "the fork", as the article says. Aside from being wasteful in terms of resources, the process of making this uneaten food generates greenhouse gases as well. I think that one main reason why so much food is wasted is because of how large the portions are. If we cut down portions to a smaller, more manageable size, I feel like food waste would go down immensely. I also figured that wind and solar power were good solutions, but never truly understood why until reading this. I strongly believe that we should move more towards solar powered energy because the sun provides clean and free energy that is unlimited, which we should take advantage of. 
             <br><br>


There were some solutions in the reading that I hadn't even thought about before, such as refrigerant management and education for girls. It's crazy to think that we have been so accustomed to technology like refrigerators that it didn't even occur to me that they had chemicals which harmed the environment and cause more heating in the atmosphere. Though it is a necessity to keep food stored and eatable, we can do more to phase out the HFCs and be more sustainable. In addition, it is important to educate girls for many reasons but it never occurred to me that it would help with the climate change issue. Overpopulation is continually becoming a greater issue, and we can curb this by giving girls proper education and teaching them about reproductive health. 

             <br><br>

Many of the solutions listed were things that I had already previously known about, but hadn't really taken time to understand. I appreciated the reading a lot because it explained the causes of these issues and laid out clear solutions for them.

I would like to acknowledge your discussion of food waste. You stated that plenty of food is wasted because of how large portions are and if they were cut down to a smaller, more manageable size. I greatly agree with this because the world does have enough food, it is not allocated right. By striving to save our planet, in many ways, we aid other problems. Perhaps food will become more available for those in need if it becomes distributed by need and not by false prediction that ultimately becomes waste. Moreover, wasting less of your own food by default means you waste less of your money! Using the entirety of your ingredients / products gives yourself the satisfaction of knowing your money was well spent. Consider apartments or smaller living spaces. Consider donating excess things away or taking up Project 333. In both scenarios, there are less things to worry about. For instance, there would be less furniture, less space to clean, less clutter, and less laundry. Your living situation would be more affordable and by giving your things away, you know that you helped others in need. Even eating a plant based diet would award an individual with health benefits. 
             <br><br>

Yes, there are sacrifices that need to be made. You might still want delicious servings of meat frequently, despite feeling cleansed, or you may feel inconvenienced being limited to public transportation or travel on foot, despite gaining exercise, saving gas money, and limiting your greenhouse gas emissions. But overall, there are more wins than losses when it comes to adopting lifestyle changes. And without making sacrifices for our earth to prosper… without accepting these “losses…” then we can consider our lives lost because there will be a point in time where inhabitants may not live to see another day.
             <br><br>

It’s a lack of panic we have. We do not feel urged to take action because it may not appear as bad yet. Personally, my experience in this class spiked my passion and inclination to consider my action’s impact on the environment on a daily basis. If the sixth extinction still is not convincing, maybe the expectations of benefits (the less spendings, more weight loss from healthy eating and proportion control, etc.) will stir them.

I felt relieve after watching Ken’s video because I always ask my family to use LED as light resources in my family. I believe that is an easy way of reducing CO2 emission since after change all lights to LED lights, the amount of electricity that my family used has obviously reduced. 

Also, it surprised me that food wastes have contribute a large portion of CO2 emission. Because based on my knowledge, lots of wasted food had been collected and reproduced to feed animals. Some of waste food in rural area in China has been reused to fertilized farmers’ field. I believe these are effective means to deal with wasted food.

I totally agree with you. I am also surprised that reducing wasted food can actually reduce so much carbon emissions and rank third in the summary table. Maybe we really should put the issue of food waste on the agenda. Moreover, reducing food waste is something that can be done easily, unlike other solutions on the list, such as using solar energy, wind energy, and even educating women. At UCSB, including me, our waste happens every day. I think we should monitor ourselves and restrain our bad habits of wasting food. At the same time, the school cafeteria should also improve the quality and taste of the dishes, or reduce the amount of each serving. If everyone can reduce a little food waste, the overall reduction is huge.


<br><hr>
You are right that using LED light bulbs could reduce emissions, but the fact is globally reducing food waste can have nearly ten times the impact of switching to LED light bulbs residentially. Hence this light bulb switch does not even enter the top 25 most important changes while reducing food waste is number three. We should know that food production is the second-largest producer of greenhouse gases on the planet but between 1/3 and half of the food will be wasted. It is also important to know that many people are profoundly taxing the resources of our planet, so reducing the population of our species is one of the main things that we can do to mitigate the climate crisis. In order to reduce the population, we should educate more girls and women which dramatically curves population growth as a more educated woman has fewer children and promote family planning. There are roughly 25 million unplanned pregnancies every year, these two things together would roll back a staggering 103 Gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions.

Reading the first 25 approaches given by Project Drawdown for addressing and reducing our greenhouse gas emission gave me a lot of hope. Sure, there is a lot of work to be done and it will take a lot of time, effort, and investment to achieve these goals, but Project Drawdown illustrates that there are numerous approaches to reducing our species impact on our climate. There is at least one substantial and greatly beneficial change that could be made in each sector of our economy, and there is a lot of opportunity, for people like me and my peers, to assist in making these changes on an administrative or public level. Discussions about climate change often leave people feeling helpless, like they are powerless in reversing the ever-warming climate. However, Project Drawdown shows that there are a lot of solutions that we are capable of achieving within the next few years. And to me, this is very exciting.
             <br><br>
I was particularly interested in the section on distributed photovoltaics. This is a subject I have become more fascinated with in recent months, and I could even see myself pursuing a future career in. While initial costs are quite high, with enough time, the effective use of solar panels will always pay for themselves. I could foresee this becoming a means for historically low income families and communities to elevate themselves out of poverty using renewable energy. With the right investments and policy, this could benefit everyone in our country and potentially the world if enough people see the opportunity that I do.

Prior to this reading, I had read that the Montreal protocol banned CFCs as they were having severe effects on the ozone layer however, I hadn't thought or heard of what would replace CFCs. After reading that CFCs had been replaced with HCFs that are more damaging for climate change I was shocked, rather than address the pollution of refrigerants and replace them with an environmentally friendly alternative like they have on the market they replaced them with something equally as bad. It was reassuring though that they mention there is an amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase HCFs out of all countries which will reduce carbon emissions tremendously from the statistics they provided. Another part of the reading I thought was interesting was how so many of the top 25 proposed solutions related to agriculture and the inefficient ways we farm. This article really lays out in fact how our diets and farming are having a profound effect on the climate but it is in our reach to reverse or stop these effects. While this article didn't delve into the need to change individuals' stigmas on making these lifestyle changes it did give a tremendous amount of support to how these changes like a plant-based diet or less food waste on the production and consumer side would cut carbon emissions by the 100s of gigatons. I agree with professor Hiltner that people are asking for how they can make a change now and this article gave 80 ways in which they could while also backing with proof of what these changes would have as an effect on global carbon emissions if implemented by everyone. Obviously, some of the proposed solutions aren't as easy to implement as others, there are plenty of necessary and easy changes proposed. For example, education to all women is a simple initiative that should be supported by all while it sadly isn't, also making contraceptives readily and cheaply available will profoundly help the environment and help empower women in more suppressive countries. Additionally, on a wider scale, our country could help less progressed countries reach clean energy and clean fuel faster than we may have to mitigate possibly more emissions as these countries develop. The goal to stop climate change is only reachable if people take action they can read all the information they want but ultimately making changes like outlined in this reading will be what helps mitigate climate change.

“Project drawdown” was an interesting read for me and a change of pace from the other readings we’ve had throughout the course so far. It was quick and easy to understand because of its relatively simple format. The cost of savings put next to the net cost surprised me for a few examples. I'm shocked at how some solutions like solar farms and wind turbines seem like such an easy solution to implement because of the overall positive savings obtained. The biggest surprise was definitely how refrigerator management has the largest possible CO2 reduction. I thought it would've been along the lines of transportation, but to see that such a common appliance is shocking to say the least.

I agree with Joshua on how straight forward the text is in "Project Drawdown". Throughout the course some of the readings we have been doing have been very difficult to understand and it makes it inaccessible to the general public. When you have something this simple it is easier for people to understand what they can do to mitigate the climate crisis. I, like many of my fellow classmates, was shocked to find out that refrigator management was the number CO2 contributor. I have never heard about the issue of HFCs and yet it is the biggest one of them all! How is it possible that we were not aware of that? I was also very shocked to see that flying was not one of the top 10 issues, it was actually number 43. Lately in lecture Ken kept mentioning how devastating flying is yet and it's scary to think about how much worse these top ten are!  I really liked the layout of "Project Drawdown" and it gave me hope that with all these possible ways to reduce CO2 we just might have a chance. If all climate change websites were as transparent and easy to read as this one, then maybe we can get more people to join in the fight against climate change.

After read those readings, I believe it gave me a new insight towards how to protect our environment. Personally, I was surprised that the top 3 method to reduce carbon dioxide are building wind turbines, reducing food wastes, and replacing chemical refrigerants. Just as the professor says in the video, comparing to other methods that are well known by people, such like switching to electronic cars and planting more trees, those three methods seem ineffective. However, the article gave us some evidences that show the opposite. Such like the statistics mentioned in the Refrigerant Management, “HFCs, the primary replacement, spare the ozone layer, but have 1,000 to 9,000 times greater capacity to warm the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.” This shows that the most effective way to reduce our carbon footprint is one that is often overlooked by people. 

 Another fact that surprised me is the educating girls. In the article, it says “Educated girls realize higher wages and greater upward mobility, contributing to economic growth. Their rates of maternal mortality drop, as do mortality rates of their babies. They are less likely to marry as children or against their will. They have lower incidence of HIV/AIDS and malaria. Their agricultural plots are more productive and their families better nourished.” I do know higher education can reduce population growth; however, I didn’t know this holds such high priority towards stopping global warming.

Great comment, Ruize. It is indeed shocking how many times those ones on the top of the list is effective at reducing human’s carbon footprint, but keep in mind that the ones Ken talked about are the ones that are much more viable to the general public. Think about it, What kind of incentives the governments across the world are gonna give to persuade every home to switch to newer ACs? Now wind turbines are actually doable but to be truly effective you still need a lot of these turbines installed. That is a lot of money, and some countries wouldn’t have the budget for this.
             <br><br>

What we could do actually is simply cut on flying and choose public transport or electric cars, these are great ways to reduce your carbon footprint and they are available today.

Before reading the summary of solutions, I had never heard of concentrated solar. I always hear that a big problem with solar energy is the lack of storage; for solar to be widely used, we would need batteries for all the times an area is not sunny. However, CSP uses mirrors to turn solar rays into heat, which is stored more easily than electricity. I was also surprised to see how cheap nuclear power would be to implement. A big problem with nuclear is the inherent risk that comes with using nuclear materials. However, nations like France know how to do nuclear right. France gets almost three quarters of its energy from nuclear sources, and they have plans to build a nuclear waste disposal facility in a deep cavern within the earth to safely dispose of what cannot be recycled. By comparison, the nuclear plants in the United States are old and rundown, having mostly been built several decades ago and left that way. There are safety concerns, but risk can be minimized through proper training of plant personnel and investment in reliable infrastructure. It is a good option for people to invest in who are especially concerned with the cost, as it is by far the cheapest option for electricity generation and provides a steady stream of energy.

             <br><br>

I was also surprised by the food solution of silvopasture. This method of integrating "trees and pasture into a single system for raising livestock" is something I have never heard of before. When I think of livestock, I first picture wide open ranges and then, less pleasantly, cramped pens. When I recently traveled across the country by train, I often looked out the window to see cows grazing in large grassy areas, but trees were few and far between. This method, which is dually beneficial economically for farmers and environmentally for everyone, should be integrated into the process of raising livestock on a large scale, perhaps as a condition for government subsidies.

I really enjoyed this reading as it was very well organized and informative, giving clear and concise solutions to the greatest issues making up the climate crisis. I especially liked the section on educating women and girls. This is an aspect that I would never have thought about as an obvious way to combat the climate crisis, but after reading the short descriptions on the effects this has, I realized how great of an impact this could really have. I was shocked to learn all the impacts including the ways in which it affects the amount and health of babies and the way it shapes the way women and girls will be equipped to face the issues of the climate crisis. This really displayed for me how interdisciplinary the solutions to this epidemic really are. We must look beyond just the immediate sources of alarm and look to the deeper social issues that are fueling this fire. 
             <br><br>
Another aspect of this reading that surprised me was the bamboo-section. I had absolutely no idea about the carbon shrinking properties of bamboo. This is an example of something I never would have thought about if I hadn’t read this article. Another aspect of the reading that shocked me was the cooking stove section, as I had never thought about this as being detrimental to our planet. I had never heard of a biomass stove, but after reading just a couple sentences about them in this reading I am curious to why they aren’t widely popular. 
             <br><br>
I think the main aspect of the reading that held the most important for me was the way it displayed so many clear facts and most importantly solutions. The inclusion of so many simple solutions in this text was the most powerful part as many times when I am reading about our climate all I feel is hopeless. I often end up thinking “Ok, so what can we do about it” after reading facts on facts about how our earth is spiraling into disaster. These solutions allow the reader to actively absorb ways they can personally make changes and see how changes can be made on the grand scheme for our earth.

Honestly, the part that I found the coolest was that ... none of those options are bad choices, and they give would-be environmental activists plenty of directions they can go in and contribute to fighting the climate crisis.

It's almost difficult to add any intelligent comment to the Project Drawdown list. It's reasonable and specific, and offers really clear ways to move forward in mitigating climate damage. Everything we've focused on before now has either been terrifying or personal, apocalyptic or morally excruciating. This wasn't either... except for the food waste/plant based diet sections, these felt like bigger systemic issues, ones approached helpfully and hopefully. Of course none of these listed issues contradict what we have been learning, but they do feel a bit more remote than flying and driving and even wildfires.

Maybe the thing that stood out to me the most was how little control I felt over the items on the list. I don't own a fridge, I certainly don't own a wind turbine or a farm... It scared me that the systemic issues that are so important to the future of our planet are so far outside of my grasp. What can I do to help create a cleaner system for cooking in rudimentary stoves?

             <br><br>

I'm glad we've spent so long focusing on what we can do personally, because this list was a lot scarier to me - it felt like a lot of things that I can't do and don't have control over, and I felt like I lost the sense of scale at times amidst all the numbers, I never felt truly clear on how effective these approaches could potentially be.

After reading this piece, I was surprised to find out that a potential solution was nuclear energy. For a long time however, it’s seems that nuclear energy is deemed as a risky and dangerous way to make energy, as the radioactive bi-product takes hundreds of years to decompose. If we as a country want to have a sustainable future of energy, we need to erase the negative stigma of nuclear every and Invest in this civilization-saving technology.

After looking through Project Drawdown and their first 25 solutions in mitigating the climate crisis, my perspective was altered yet again. While there are numerous possibilities for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from an individual to a group level, I was shocked at which ones were the most impactful on ozone depletion and heating. Refrigerant management in my opinion was something that had never crossed my mind to be such an issue. After reading the short message, I discovered that the replacement for CFCs (finally phased out by the Montreal Protocol), HFCs, have a one thousand to nine thousand times greater capacity to warm the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. Another solution that really grabbed my attention was the educating girls and family planning section. Education is key to combating these kinds of issues. It is hard to recognize a problem if you don't even know there is a problem at all. Focusing on education to reduce even small things like population growth will be beneficial to emission reduction. Sources like these should receive a greater amount of attention than which they are receiving. Project Drawdown provided an effective and relatively easy way to inform people on the potential solutions to reducing our emissions.

<p>
After reading the solutions given by Project Drawdown, I am optimistic about our future in stopping the climate crisis and saving the planet. This project gives a lot of feasible solutions for us to take action on protecting the environment, like reducing food waste. I remember at a birthday party, we ordered 8 pizzas, but we only ate 4 of them. The rest was thrown away. After I take Eng 23, I think of a lot of things I've done before that have been bad for the environment. And I am trying to correct it. 
             <br><br>
The author also mentions a solution that can have an impact on the environment by educating girls. Today, there are economic, cultural, and safety-related barriers that impede 62 million girls around the world from realizing their right to education. Education also shores up resilience and equips girls and women to face the impacts of climate change. Women who went to college have a great chance that decides born less child. They also will learn that their duties were not to give birth to a child and take care of her family members, but to work, to achieve their dreams, or to do anything they want to do. I think we can achieve the goal of getting more girls into college by making school affordable; helping girls overcome health barriers; reducing the time and distance to get to school and making schools more girl-friendly.
             <br><br>
Hope we can save the planet.

This video was one of my favorites so far because it talks about things we can do to evoke change both at home and on a larger scale. Even as I watched this video, as soon as Ken talked about unplugging our chargers when they’re not in use, I stood up and did just that. Obviously it may be a little harder to just get rid of my car and switch to a more green solution, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. I feel like a lot of people are tempted to get into the mentality that the climate crisis is already so far along that there really isn’t any point in trying to stop it, if there is anything we can do to stop it. This video assuages those doubts, allowing people to evoke the change they want so badly but can’t because they simply don’t know how. 
             <br><br>

Even on the subject of electing government officials, people often just don’t take the climate crisis into consideration when casting their vote, when it is in fact probably the most important and effective way of creating change. I’m glad that people, including myself, now have an accurate and unbiased source to understand not only the detriments of the climate crisis, but what we can do to stop it as well.

Hi Conner! I completely agree with you about the importance and the influence this video had over me. I am currently sitting at my desk and I am only using 1 out of the three plugs I have connected to power, so obviously I unplugged them! My question is: why did the thought to unplug the unnecessary plugs only occur to me after I watched the video? I can bet that people are more likely keep chargers and lights plugged in than to unplug them every time they leave the house or they are not in use; so what steps can be taken to make the norm to be more energy conscious? 
             <br><br>
In reply to getting rid of your car, don't get rid of it! Carpool, bike shorter distances, buy a car that has better gas mileage, and be practical about how much you travel and how much gas you use. I love that UCSB is such a bike-friendly campus, but we are also pretty far from Santa Barbara proper. We have the option to take the free bus, drive ourselves, or uber; you would think that bussing would be the best option, but sometimes it just isn't time efficient. Public transportation needs to be better developed and more accessible to the whole population. 
             <br><br>
I think educating people on climate change and the steps each individual can take to eliminate waste and their carbon foot print is the best thing we can do as a whole.
<br><hr>
I really agree with your points. For me as well, it’s really hard to just get rid of the car, and bicycle to everywhere. However, it’s really easy for us to just unplug what we are not in use. As everyone is doing it, then the world will be better. It’s so true that many people put a negative view on the climate crisis. They think that since everything has already done, and there would be no efficient way to stop it. As a result, they just ignore the problem and keep doing the same thing that harm the earth.




<br><hr>

I completely agree with your sentiment on how some people want change but don’t know where to start. We can all do something right now just like you unplugged your charger, even though the act is simple, overtime everything starts to add up. I feel like if people were approached with solutions or actions in a clear and simple way like Project Drawdown does, they would be more willing to help and begin changing habits. I think part of the problem with the climate crisis is that everything is so confusing and complicated with loads of misinformation and the solution has to viable for people of all backgrounds and disciplines in life.

I appreciate the section on a plant based diet. When I was going vegetarian, or when I have talked to people about it, so many people tell me that one person eating this way wont do anything, and I always say that its a drop in the bucket. Also I did not know that the difference between a vegan diet and a  vegetarian one is only 7%. I always thought vegan made a much larger difference than vegetarianism.
             <br><br>

I think the section on nuclear energy brought up many good points, and covered all angles, however they did not propose a solution to the dilemma, which I would have liked to see.
             <br><br>

The bamboo section was interesting as well. I did not know it thrived on inhospitable land, or that it is one of the fastest plants to intake and store carbon. Also that it grows to its full height in one year is incredible.

Similar to you I fully agree with the nuclear energy solution. The future is nuclear energy. Its clean , is efficient, and provides so much energy is ridiculous. One of my major criticisms , and of many others, of the Green New Deal is its lack of Nuclear energy. There is basically no reason not to use nuclear energy. I think a major issue with why we have such a struggle with bringing up nuclear energy is the stigma. There is the massive stigma that the nuclear plants could blow up and cause massive damage that are drastically worse than if an electrical plant did so. The issue with this premise is that nowadays there are so many precautions on a nuclear plant that it's basically impossible for that to happen.
             <br><br>

Your ideas on a plant based diet is similar to many such as mine. A vegan lifestyle from a vegetarian is very different, both require immense will but its a known fact that veganism is much harder. Albeit it's only a 7% difference when it comes to helping the earth. Even though it's a small difference it would be beneficial to us all if everyone was vegan.

It took me quite a while to understand this chart and I had to follow virtually every link on the page. But the biggest suprise to me was how much would be saved through Project Drawdown versus how much would be spent. 30,000 dollars is about three years at UCSB. 74,000 dollars is enough money to send me through grad school and halfway through a doctorate. This is attainable money, especially with the amount that could be saved, and the environmental impact would be well worth it even if the money was not. I was especially intrigued by the Indegenous People’s Land Managment portion. I have followed situations like the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Mauna Telescope and considered what an important role indeginous communities could play in leading the world into a greener life. I like that this portion of the website points out that these communities may be some of the most at risk groups in terms of climate crisis; and that they are leading some of the most active and comprehensive movements to protect  the earth currently. Lastly, I found grid flexbility very interesting. I had never heard of that, and I think i will do more research on it to see how it might be implimented in our cities.

I think Project Drawdown is an extremely informative list that can help the average person get a grasp about carbon emissions and what can be done to remedy emissions. I personally found it fascinating how certain things such as the utilization of refrigerants topped the list  despite me having zero previous knowledge in the topic. As addressed by Ken, I have NEVER heard the media talk about the issue, yet it supposedly has 1,000 to 9,000 times greater capacity to warm the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. Apparently, the reduction of these can reduce projected temperate change by an entire degree! Compared to the majority of other things we can do to reduce emissions, this is almost unfathomably large. 
             <br><br>
After looking at the list, I also realized the other things that can help contribute that I never even would've thought about. For example, the amount of land restoration and improved farming practices that should be implemented for reduction is seemingly endless. To be honest, I didn't even know what peatlands were before just now reading about them, but apparently they cover an entire 3% of the earth's surface. This list just goes to show how little knowledge the average person has regarding energy conservation and CO2 emissions. Thankfully, I am now more aware of what I can do to help the environment.

<p>
I really enjoyed reading this list for the simple fact that I genuinely found the list and its contents quite interesting. It was fascinating reading all the statistical data present for each respective change that a country, region, and/or individual could make that would positively impact the environment. I have to say, I was actually incredibly surprised that the number one slot belonged to changing the chemicals present in refrigerants. I honestly think that's one of the last things I would have thought would cause high emission rates and be incredibly damaging to our environment. I would have thought that switching to began or vegetarian diets, or switching transportation methods would have been the top slot. I find that each week I become more and more surprised by just how many things have such adverse impacts on our climate.
             <br><br>
Something else I also really like about the list is the fact that the suggestions themselves are presented as a list with quick and concise descriptions/statistics. It made me, somebody who I would say is generally more aware of just how intensely humans are affecting and accelerating climate change, understand and digest the information much easier than if all the suggestions were just spewed out as me in rapid succession; I can only imagine how much more approachable it would make tackling climate change solutions be to the average American, or person in general.

I also found it surprising that chemicals present in refrigerants are number one on the list. I would have thought that transportation and housing had higher greenhouse gas emissions. It was really shocking to see that transportation was number 26 on the list considering that we usually often hear more about the problems and effects of cars and transportation in general. I always hear people say to switch to electric cars, bike, or take public transportation, but the transportation sector is not even in the top 25 on the list. Even family planning comes before the transportation sector. This shows us that we are not as informed as we should be. The list of solutions is a good plan and an example of where we should be headed with sustainability and the steps we should take toward saving our environment. Although I feel like some of these solutions have not been considered, like changing to a more plant-based diet, people should become more informed on the ways they can help reverse the climate crisis.


</span></div><hr>


<p>
After reading this top 25 solutions and watching Ken’s video, i felt optimistic. Because i knew that there are many things we can do to contribute to reduce greenhouse gas emission.
             <br><br>
I was surprised to know the refrigerants that refrigerators and air conditioners contain is the main contribution to the emission of CO2 since refrigerators and air conditioners are one of the most important things in our house and i can’t imagine the life without them. This make me feel worry and contradictory because of the harm refrigerants take to environment and the necessity of those refrigerants. And it is said that 90% of the refrigerants emission happen at end of life. After knowing all this, it’s comforting to know we still have solution by disposing effectively, carefully removed and store so that refrigerants can be purified for reused or transformed to other environmental friendly chemical.
             <br><br>
I also strongly agree with the education part. It said that girls should be educated. This solution can help reduce CO2 emission from different aspect. Educated women can contribute by having less children which help to control the population and indirectly reducing the CO2 emission. And educated women can manage family plan better by planning the family’s plants based diets. Several solutions which can help women to be educated are listed and i think this could be a solution with strong executive.
             <br><br>
As for me, i will change my lifestyle according to the reading and Ken’s suggestions. I will have more plant-base diet instead of eating meat. This will be very beneficial not only for reducing CO2 emission but also make me more healthier and prevent me from chronic disease. And i will also reduce the waste of food by not taking too much food from the dining common. I used to take lots of food and waste a lot since i overestimate my appetite. But i’ve changed my bad habit a lot now by taking less food and i found out that i can’t actually eat that much.

I completely agree with you! I have remained very optimistic about what we can do to help mitigate the climate crisis. While I know a lot of them have to do with changes beyond what most of us can do personally, I feel like this reading opened my eyes to things that can be done on a personal level that rank high on the list of solutions. I, too, was surprised to see refrigerant management as the number one solution. I would never have even guessed this as a main concern in considering what can be done to help the climate crisis. Luckily this class is giving me new sources and information so that I can help spread important information that is often looked over. As Ken mentioned, this form of mitigation is not publicized nearly enough and seems like a straightforward method that many can adapt. I do believe that making personal changes kills two birds with one stone: mitigating the climate crisis while also improving your overall well being in a variety of aspects. As you mentioned, adopting a largely plant based, reducing food waste, and promoting education are just a few ways that have just as great impacts on the environment as it does in general. This list provided a greater understanding of solutions that can reduce our carbon emissions from many different angles, we just have to take action and adopt them long term so that the climate crisis can be contained and improved before it gets worse.

Reading the first 25 approaches of solutions in the project drawdown was very insightful. This class is constantly changing my perspective and showing me that there are more ways to lessen our carbon footprint. Before taking this class, I assumed the meat-industry contributed most to the climate crisis. After last week's lecture, I thought using public transportation would be more effective, but after reading this, I've learned that those are just part of the solution. And a very small portion. In the first 25 approaches, it is even ranked on most effective to least effective. Going through each of them, I did not even realize some were an issue or that some could be a way to help the environment. I did not know that refrigerators were a large part of the problem, I did not know silvopasture could be a thing. I even enjoyed how they showed their sectors, the total atmospheric co2 reduction, the net cost, and savings. One thing that also caught me off guard was how educating women and young girls could also be a benefit to a planet. While I've always believed anyone should have access to a good education, regardless of class or gender, I did not realize the sequence of results that would follow could also help the climate crisis. Last year I took a feminist studies class, and we learned the effectiveness of women being educated about their bodies. While there was a sense of sexual liberation,  the class also taught me that there was a direct link between educated women and having kids. Knowing this already, it never crossed my mind that that could benefit the environment as a bonus.

This week's reading made me feel optimistic and gave me hope that there could be change in the future to help reduce emissions. I really like the impact statements on the sidebar because I was able to put these things in perspective and it made me feel hopeful that this next generation can help the climate crisis. I had some ideas for what the biggest problems to the climate crisis were but I would have never thought refrigerants to have the impact that they have on the planet. I was surprised to see it as the number one on the list. Another one that I found was interesting was switching to a plant-based diet which I already knew of. I liked how they mentioned that although it may be hard to switch everyone to a plant-based diet because of cultural and personal ideas, just introducing more plant-based options and making them available will help. I am vegetarian, and every time I go out to eat with my friends it is always a struggle because several of the options on the menu come with meat. I think restaurants should open their availability to more people and introduce more plant-based meals.

I thought the same things as Rubi for my initial impression. I found that it was optimistic to have concrete steps that you can take that don't involve not flying and learning what recycling is. I also thought that refrigerants were a surprising topper of the list, but the more I read the explanation, the more it made sense to me why it was in the position that it was. Air conditioning is terrible for the environment and releases massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and if every single person owned one in every room of their house in India, they would genuinely be swimming in their grave every single summer. In addition, it made sense to me why plant and food were some of the top reasons on how to decrease the intensity of the climate crisis. Part of me wants to say its for the animals and their conditions, but plain and simple, the reason that we need to stop eating meat is simply because if we keep going down the rabbit hole that we are with our population growing, there will be nowhere to keep these cows in order to sustain the demand. If beef became a hot commodity, I believe that our numbers would decrease significantly for CO2 production.

I was surprised to hear that reducing food waste was the third-best solution to solving climate change. I feel like this one is very achievable due to the amount of food we waste. If more cafeterias in America donated their food they made but no one ate to homeless shelters and other food services we could drastically reduce that amount we waste. Places like school cafeterias always make too much food because it is too hard to accurately predict how much will be consumed for the given meal so instead they stay on the safe side and make too much. I think donating the extra food and serving smaller portions is the easiest way we could make a big dent on the climate crisis.



</p><hr>


<p>

I was extremely surprised by what the top 25 things we can do to reduce climate change were. I started the list and was almost in disbelief when I saw the #1 strategy was refrigerant management, something I had never even heard of before the reading. I had also never heard of a lot of the other strategies listed such as silvopastures and afforestation. I am saddened that many of the things we do hear about how to combat climate change do not actually make much of a difference, such as buying an electric car or switching to LED lights. I wish the general public were more educated on actual, effective techniques to combat climate change.
             <br><br>
I was also surprised by how many of these strategies would save money in the long run. Most strategies had savings that far outweighed the net cost, and some even had a negative net cost (meaning it saves money to do this). This leads to the question of why these techniques are not being put in place. If it both saves money and is good for the planet, why aren't more people implementing them? I think this comes back to the idea of the general public not being educated. I think if people were informed on effective ways to combat the climate crisis that would save money, those people would be open to it and the planet would be helped. We need to make sure that more people are aware of these not obvious, yet extremely successful, ways to help the planet.

Similar to the sentiment of many comments, I was surprised by the fact that refrigerators have such a large environmental impact. I have never heard of refrigerators as a contributor of global warming, despite the fact that there has been a global conference regarding this matter. All I have ever seen are the energy saving labels on some relatively newer models of refrigerators, but if HFCs are the real problem, I am wondering why it has not been brought to the attention of the general public. Like Ken mentions, switching light bulbs and other actions are always suggested to help the environment, yet things like refrigerants and food waste are not as known. Regardless, seeing that the Kigali accord will deal with this issue provides hope that the world is progressing in bringing efforts to mitigate climate change.
             <br><br>
Also, I did not expect to see improvements on rice production to be so high up on this list. The methods to improve it help reduce both carbon dioxide and methane emissions and improve production efficiency. But, like the other agricultural changes on the list, farmers will have to become educated on the positive effects of the techniques and reverse conventional wisdom. So, it will be interesting to see how soon it will be adapted on a larger scale.

Also like you, I found the idea of refrigerator and air conditioning management having a huge environmental impact so surprising and foreign. I was so very grateful for this reading, as I wouldn't of known of the damage that my refrigerator/AC unit has on the environment. I had never heard of refrigerators having such an impact, as ive always learned that other factors take a large part of carbon dioxide output. Our use of cars, housing, etc. are so much more common in the conversation of climate change. Although these factors are important when talking about global solutions, most people aren't aware of other huge factors. Trying to solve global issues such as food waste, feminine education, and refrigerator management are so very important in helping to steer our actions into the right direction, but are not very popular in the general population. 
             <br><br>
A couple questions I had in mind when I read your comment were; Although the general public doesn't have widespread knowledge of these issues, but a vague idea, what are steps that we can take to educate individuals on these less known topics? When and where do we start substituting and educating the public on the damage of refrigerants to the earth?

Most every time I leave lecture or finish one of the assignments for this class, I feel discouraged and just sad. I feel like what ever I do, I am destroying everything. Sure that sounds dramatic, but a lot fo what we have covered, is pretty disheartening. I am pleased to say, that this weeks reading actually made me feel good and hopeful. "Project Drawdown" actually poses solutions to our dire situation. I will say I am surprised tho. From what we cover in class and read about, I had some ideas about what was the biggest problem and what would affect us the most if fixed. Would I have guessed it was refrigerators. Nope. Refrigerant management is news to me.  Focusing on controlling leakages and the removal/recycling process of refrigerators and appliances is interesting. Overtime, appliances get better and better. They can store more, are colder, more stylish and so much more. People are constantly out with the old and in with the new. But what happens with the old appliances. Do they just rot, are the reused? The harsh chemicals and parts used in the appliances are not properly recycled or destroyed. This damaging effect of these bad appliances needs to be changed. One point that Ken has brought up in the past is children. It never really occurred to me that having more children could be a bad thing. Adopting is a very good alternative. Unplanned pregnancies are becoming more and more regular and upcoming parents are not prepared. I learned more about the importance of teaching people about planning for pregnancies and all that accompanies it as well as being better suited to prevent pregnancies.

I agree with you. Usually after watching the films and doing the readings I feel sad and hopeless. I feel like the world is never going to get better because nobody is going to be on board with the solutions. After reading about the “project drawdown” though I have a different view on it. I also didn’t realize refrigerators were so bad. It’s nice that this gave so many solutions to the climate change problem because people really think it’s all pollution and fossil fuels. The fact of the matter is that it is so much more. There is so many things that play a key role in climate change that you don’t realize and that is what this weeks reading addressed.

I find this summary of solutions to be straightforward and informative. Each section is followed by a list of sources which boosts its credibility. The way the solutions are ranked surprised me and would probably surprise a lot of people. The number one solution of refrigerant management was completely new to me, but explained well and supported by numbers, I understand its impact. I appreciate the ranking because it is important to understand how impactful solutions really are and can help us as a society to focus on the most important things. Many people may be changing their lifestyles in relatively minimally impactful ways without realizing it. For example, many people (in our consumer culture…)- and even our society in general-focus on buying an electric car before they focus on eating less meat. This is partly because consumption is already our pattern while changing our diets requires more thought and real change. What is damaging is that some things like buying an electric car can make someone feel that they have done their part environmentally and even that every day they are out driving it they are still helping. This ranking places electric vehicles at 26 while reduced food waste and plant-rich diet are in the top 4. Ignorance may be bliss for many people who have the means to buy an electric car and then feel they have done thousands of dollars worth of saving the planet. This ranking is important because it highlights where we really would make the most difference. While our consumer culture may focus more on electric cars that vegan diets, this credible, straightforward ranking could help us rearrange our priorities.

This week's reading has given me a sense of hope. Compared to previous reading that were focused on the downfall of man due to climate change, this week was focused on solutions. I Thought it was interesting to find that there are many steps that we can take-no matter how small they be-in order to create a large change in CO2 emissions. Thus can be seen when it was discussed that if we were to manage our food waste our carbon footprint would dramatically decrease. "First World" Countries do not have the issue of a shortage of food rather one of meeting the standard of an appealing cosmetic. "Project Drawdown" states that, "The food we waste is responsible for roughly 8 percent of global emissions". Eight percent does not seem significant, but when you see that it is able to prevent 26.2 gigatons of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere one's perspective changes drastically. This all could be avoided if we were to reevaluate what our standards when it comes to food. Why should a bump or imperfection bother us? We are causing harm not only to the farmers, but to the environment when doing so.

             <br><br>

Another solution mentioned in "Project Drawdown", was leading a lifestyle that is plant-based. I know it may not be realistic for some people to fully adopt these eating habits in their everyday lives, but even small efforts will be largely rewarded. I know looking at these solutions may be a bit daunting because it has us reevaluate our current lifestyles, but if we were to accept that these small sacrifices could lead to a better future-it would make it a whole lot more manageable.

I liked this article because it very clearly lists what we can do to lower our carbon footprint and how much money it will cost/save and how much emissions it will reduce. I think this article should be published everywhere and this information should be widespread knowledge. I study environmental studies and I had no idea that refrigerant management was the #1 way to reduce emissions. It fascinates me how little the public knows and what is chosen to be discussed versus what isn’t. I sent my parents this article because although they can unfortunately be stubborn it is still important for them to be informed so they can make educated decisions on how they live. I hope that the more people know and are educated the more they will implement these changes into their daily lifestyles.

I was really shocked at the amount of Carbon dioxide emissions that can be produced by refrigerant management. I never realized how many chemicals and waste can be disposed of from a refrigerator. It is astonishing to know that HFCs have 1000 to 9000 times greater capacity to warm the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. The Kigali accord will be responsible for reusing or transforming the chemicals that do not cause warming. We really need to make use of 21st-century technology to ensure we can successfully reuse or dispose of chemicals and emissions. We have the necessary platforms and technology to change the world right now and save the Earth from becoming an uninhabitable place.

"Project Drawdown" offered up the solutions I have been seeking since starting this class. There were also some very interesting revelations about what those solutions turned out to be. It seems like the most effective ways to fight off climate change and reduce emissions can start at the home. For example, refrigerant management and the use of HFCs was at the top at the list. Moreover, like reduced food waste and plant-based diets are solutions that can be implemented at any time. It just requires a change within oneself. 
             <br><br>
I also found it interesting that many of the solutions proposed still guaranteed profits. I feel that a big reason why conservatives are so quick to deny climate change policy is its costs. In addition, fossil fuel interests and climate deniers seem to be so concerned with profit. However, the solutions proposed still show how worthwhile an investment in climate-conscious technologies is. Trillions of dollars can be saved and generated, and we can respect the environment. We can truly have both, we've just been told and taught that we have to choose.

I agree with many things you said, Aubrey! This class was beginning to make me feel like we had very little hope of fixing our planet, considering that many of the solutions Ken has offered up have not been things that I could realistically see many individuals implementing (outside of the students in our class). This list, though, offered many solutions that big businesses as well as individual people can start to engage in. Like you said in terms of making changes within oneself, I would like to start moving towards a plant-based diet (especially after watching “Cowspiracy”) and focusing on reducing how much food I waste. I’m definitely guilty of ordering too much food and not being able to finish it, and I didn’t realize just how big of an impact I can make by changing little habits like that. I want to encourage my family to try to do the same thing; I have 2 parents and 3 younger siblings, so that could mean 6 people would be making more sustainable life choices. It may not seem significant, but everything counts. Even convincing my parents to make sure that we have a sustainable refrigerator would make a difference.

             <br><br>

In addition to that, I was also glad that many changes that businesses and farmers could make would still be profitable. Silvopasture, regenerative agriculture, and tree intercropping all seem like just a few things farmers could be doing to benefit themselves AND the planet. It is understandable that some of these things may be too expensive for smaller farms to implement (silvopasture was said to be costly), but I would hope that farmers who could afford to make changes would see the benefits. It’s hard to break people away from tradition, but it’s hard to argue against the positive impacts for everyone and everything involved.


<br><hr>
All the conservatives and climate change deniers that are quickly denying climate change are all focused on the short term profits. Just like the fossil fuel industry, they know it's not long term sustainable but they will keep it running for however long they can to make as much profit as possible right now. As you can see reading through all of these solutions, a lot of them has a very high initial investments and those investments are only refunded after decades of use. It disgusts me that even if you don't believe in climate change we know that the fossil fuel industry is not sustainable so we will have to make the change at some point in the future. It just shows all of these people aren't thinking about the future of the world. As we saw by a lot of these solutions, not only will it help our future generations, but a lot of them help our current generation such as the farming solutions. The farming solutions for integrated tree growth with crops and reduced use of pesticides will help current farmers and people around the world.
             <br><br>
I also found your point about how fighting off climate change starts in the household interesting.  I completely agree with you, while I don't think individuals in themselves can make a huge change by themselves how we approach the issue will start a wave until it reaches the government. For instance, individuals wasting less food, installing solar panels, and going vegan or vegetarian will show our representatives what we want as a country and where we want to go.

Like many others, I was really surprised by #1, the most effective way to cut down on CO2 emissions relating back to my fridge! I surely thought it was going to be about our diet, housing, or transportation first. Reduced food waste and a plant-rich diet did end up making it on the top ten, but it still caught me off guard seeing refrigerant management. If plugging and unplugging my phone would be equivalent to tapping the Titanic with a teaspoon, I thought to some extent it would be the maintenance for a fridge. From the excerpt, this reading taught me how refrigerators have chemicals that pose a threat against our atmosphere -- specifically HFCs having 1,000 to 9,000x greater capacity to warm the atmosphere over carbon dioxide! An alternative is yet to be made for HFCs and unplugging and plugging it is not exactly an effective method… However, disposing of them is and that is something to keep in mind. I think it’s very important to consider how things can be reused and how the technology and science we have today can transform those dangerous, toxic chemicals to something that does not raise concerns of global warming.
             <br><br>

As Ken said in his video, the top three solutions would do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions than the rest combined. In second place is wind turbines. Now, based on advertisement, I anticipated “eco-friendly” things from electric vehicles to environmentally conscious power and energy. Though for the latter, I expected the solution to be the more accessible options for households like installing solar panels to particular bulbs. I understand now why wind turbines would be so important, considering the ginormous carbon footprint that corporations have because of their production. I find it very efficient, using what we have to make something good out of it to benefit our planet. It’s like the passing on of clothing to be reused, except on a larger scale.
             <br><br>

It does make me sad though that the second ranked solution is more in the hands of companies that have not been taking precautions in the first place. It makes me feel hopeless, until I’m reminded that I can still play a part. Not wasting, or wasting less food, is ten times more of an impact than the expected eco-friendly electricity. This is something in my control and it relieves me more that UCSB strives to reduce waste in dining commons and put the food into work somehow, even as compost. A plant-rich diet is next, but not surprising either. A lot feel out of my control and this list does not inspire me as a previous lecture did, noting how I could reduce my carbon output from whole chunks based on diet, housing, transportation, materials owned, and so forth. I do acknowledge and feel more secure seeing that we are not limited in solutions, but I must urge those in power to make changes and offer support.

I was also very shocked when I read that refrigerant management was the top way to cut our emissions! I had previously never heard about refrigerators releasing HFCs, just like I had no idea that HFCs have 1000 to 9000 times the capacity to heat the atmosphere. This made me reflect on what the media choses to make a big deal. I remember watching commercials when I was younger telling me to switch my light bulbs from LED to fluorescent light bulbs. As if changing light bulbs has nearly the same effect as demanding the phasing out of HFCs. The information that the media publicizes is incredibly insignificant to the real problems that we should focus more attention on. For instance, electric cars are highly publicized and praised for being the solution to our emission problem with cars. However, the media doesn't like to share how creating electric cars emits approximately the same amount as driving a regular car would. The one sided stories and hidden truths in regard to our emissions results in a majority of the population uneducated.

Project Drawdown really does seem to be a compelling list of solutions to help guide us on our way to a more sustainable future. I think one of the most important things Ken touched upon in this video was the fact that out of the 25 things listed, even if we accomplished the entire bottom half of the list, it would not have more impact than the first 3 on the list. It goes to show how important it is that we start with the biggest issues first, and maybe get the smaller items on the list after. The change needs to be from the top down in order to get any real results in the time that we need them. Personally I don't own any type of vehicle, I share housing with other like-minded environmentalists, and I tend towards a vegetarian diet 95% of the time. I still think there's more I can do personally to help cut down consumer emissions even further than just these three things, but the important fact here is that I've addressed the top three things on the list  and can only continue to lessen my impact from here on. If more people did this it would make an astonishing impact I believe, but globally it's really a matter of wasting less and lowering population growth rates as Ken said. It's wild to think that 60 years ago there were only 3.5bil humans on the planet and now we have over 7.5bil people, and that number continues to grow everyday. This really isn't a matter of waiting for new technology to be created, because the solutions are all things we can implement right now.

<p>

I never knew how much I myself could have the problem, I've shared this video along with several others with many of my friends and family members who said that an individual could never have a significant impact but it really only takes one person at a time. As Ken pointed out in the video, it is very easy to understand what we are consuming and how to be better about it. we have to start understanding otherwise it will all be over, There will be nothing left to fight for if people refuse to fight for it now. My dad asks me all the time "what's the point of you being a vegetarian if the world is going to die?" Everytime I tell him that its my responsibility to do my part and that that is all any of us can do.

Although I consider myself a supporter of the climate movement, I’m thankful we weren’t required to read through all 100 summaries. Thanks, Ken! Sure, the summaries’ lengths may come across as habitual for your typical climate activist, but each solution's page packed far too much information into a single topic-- if you wanted to find out more about each one, you would need to click through every single page. I feel like it would be much more beneficial to us, as a short-attention-span’d nation, to incorporate small summaries into each subject on the ranking list (which I thought was thoughtful and concise), and then maybe a larger dropdown description that goes more in-depth into each matter’s facts, association to other solutions, and perhaps even a section that details its statistics.

“Project Drawdown” lists and rank a number of method people can do to make positive impact on the environment facing the serious problem of global warming. It is refreshing to learn that Refrigerant management is ranked as number one method. It basically refers to “controlling leakages of refrigerants from existing appliances through better management practices and recovery, recycling, and destruction of refrigerants at the end of life”. Also, it is surprising that education girls, which seems to have very little relation with environmental protection, has be ranked as 6th solution.

I feel relaxed when I read this week’s reading assignment because many solutions of saving our environments are clearly listed. At the same time, this reading is kind of optimistic relative to previous ones. We can get the direction how we can do for ourselves and our future generations. Although there are so many solutions we have read, some of them are not very complete to use. In the 25 solutions we have read, I am interested in the geothermal power, which is also called earth heat. Indeed, it is one double-edged sword. The benefit for geothermal is that it is almost a perpetual-motion machine which will not be affected by weather condition and have no fuel costs. Yet, it is very rare and possibly cause small earthquake during production of geothermal power. As a result, we still need to work on the technique to make the use of geothermal more efficiently and securely. Meanwhile, geothermal has a promising “future”. The impact of mature geothermal is huge and extensive. By 2050, reduce emissions by 16.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide and save $1 trillion in energy costs over thirty years and $2.1 trillion over the lifetime of the infrastructure. What is really striking data. Besides, geothermal also can supports the progress of other useful renewable energy. For example, because of the unstable weather condition, the offshore wind turbines cannot keep operating. In this kind of situation, geothermal is a good choice to use, as it can run in any weather condition.
             <br><br>
What’ s more, the food waste is one of the core problems in the worldwide. In the reading material, it mentioned that the food we waste is responsible for roughly 8% of global emissions. Connecting to the film Cowspiracy, there is huge amount of methane produced by the cows when they are made into beef. But they actually do not send to our dinner table. The unnecessary waste should be minimized.

I too felt much more at ease after reading these listings. Compared to what we’ve been reading the past 5 weeks, this is a hopeful note that I think was much needed. However, I don’t think I want this reading to make me feel too at ease and while that may sound quite contradictory the reason is because I feel like if any individual feels too calm then the urgency of the climate crisis will lower and disappear once again. I also agree with you mentioning what’s still wrong with these methods that people believe that could play a big part in reversing climate change such as geothermal heat. These methods are most definitely not perfected but with time I think it’s something more than worth the time spent to perfect it considering that the survival of our planet depends on it. 
             <br><br>

What I think hit me the hardest was reading about the food waste, especially as someone who already thinks so strongly on unnecessarily throwing away food and simply managing what one can actually eat and finish. It made me quite upset realizing that these almost ‘beauty’ standards that have been brought upon the female and male gender have somehow been corrupted enough to be applied to the very thing all individuals need to survive. It was quite ridiculous to me reading that a whole THIRD of vegetables and produce don’t make it out of the farms because they were crooked or a little bruised. This is meant to be a means to nutrition and survival and yet its being thrown out because it’s looks isn’t up to standards. If and hopefully not when the downfall of this planet occurs, we will be the only ones to blame.

It's shocking how the top 3 items listed on the Project Drawdown are more impactful than the bottom 75 combined. It is shocking that refrigeration management is the number one issue on the list. I have never heard about HFCs in fridges in the press. You only really hear about electric cars, LED lightbulbs, wind turbines, solar panels, turning your lights off, etc. in the news. I never would've known that the more education women receive, the less pregnancies there are, which substantially limits the carbon footprint released into the world. This class is teaching me so many new things I never may have learned on my own. The amount of CO2 saved by following the suggestions made by Project Drawdown is insane. Trillions of pounds of CO2... WHAT?!? CRAZY!

I was also extremely shocked at the monumental impact the top items on the Project Drawdown list were causing! I can relate to you in that before exploring the website, I never knew that our refrigeration was one of the largest concerns for carbon emissions and so promising of solutions. I’m glad that I hold this knowledge now and can carry it with me for my future home decisions, but as the case typically seems to be through taking this course, I wish I knew about this problem sooner. Honestly, I feel like I possess generally well-rounded information regarding the climate crisis, yet I was unaware of HFC’s 1-9 thousand times greater atmospheric warming impact compared to carbon dioxide. With media attention being focused towards mainstream climate solutions, such as wind turbines and veganism, other prevalent contributors get swept under the rug while utility companies continue to profit. 
             <br><br>
Also, touching on your mention of women education, it is interesting how environmental solutions are intertwined with social ones; often it is the foundation of a society-for example, living in proximity of accessible contraception, religious and moral values, gender roles, and so much more- that affect the rate of population growth. If we do not provide information and resources, there will not be much progress in halting overpopulation.

<br><Hr>
It was definitely unexpected to hear about how huge a contributor refrigerators are, but when you really think about it of course it makes sense, they're constantly running. It's also pretty interesting to consider how you can make the connections between this lecture and the overall theme of this week surrounding food waste. I mean, consider how we use refrigerators in order to preserve our leftover food, and food waste is such a contributor and it just seems that everything is all tied together, all marching us towards an environmental suicide. But also as your enthusiasm marks, there is some hope in acknowledging just how much Project Drawdown is contributing to the preservation of CO2. There is still hope yet, I do remain optimistic, in believing we can dig ourselves out from this hole.

This is a great list that needs to be shared everywhere because Project Drawdown does an amazing job breaking down all of the top topics that can reduce climate change. They do a great job explaining how the particular case can be solved to reduce the climate footprint and also provides an insight into the amount of positive impact it can have on the planet. I would consider it a reliable resource for people who have no clue about what is contributing to the climate crisis and what ways they can make a change to help mitigate it. A person who does not know that eating meat plays a significant role in producing emissions would read the section and realize that becoming vegan or vegetarian could reduce their footprint by 70% and 63% respectively. It serves as a guide for anyone in the world to learn about the crisis better and evaluate their life and make necessary changes where they can play their part in this predicament. 

             <br><br>

The way it is organized is also very user-friendly, so it would not be that difficult to navigate. There are two other things I like about this website. Firstly, the summaries are concise and clear making it straight to the point that way a person reading it can understand the information they are absorbing easily. Secondly, I admire how they included their sources right below their summaries that way an individual reading a statistic for example could see where the source is coming from. It shows the credibility of the website because Project Drawdown is collecting outside, reliable sources instead of just making up sources themselves. 

             <br><br>

Most of the solutions such as switching to a heavy plant-based diet and not wasting food, I would consider being relatively easier than the other cases because it is something personal. However, I must note that changing what you eat has cultural ties, so it may not be easy to do so or simply the fact that a person may not be in the space where they can stop buying meat because of how much more money plant-based foods are. It is possible though, but there are obstacles we must address and find ways to come around it. I didn't even know that air conditioning and having refrigerators were a huge contributor to the Climate Crisis. I honestly do not know what a person could do on a personal level to lower their footprint besides getting rid of it altogether. This is a question that needs to be solved and we need to do everything we can to find solutions.

I was surprised to learn that the top 6 and 7 most effective solutions to decreasing CO2 emissions into our atmosphere were educating girls and family planning. Although I knew that a rapidly growing population size is a problem, I never accounted for why or how it becomes a problem for our environment. It made me realize how much work we still have to do politically. Education systems around the world do not provide the correct resources for young girls and deprive women of having an accurate and in-depth sexual education. Even in the United States, a country where women have rights, the education system breezes through topics in sex ed and prefers that children are taught about it at home. It is also a problem that the burden of having children is always placed on women, when women do not have proper access to birth control resources around the world. I think it is important recognize programs like the Peace Corps that go out and educates low-income countries about health and sex education because it is not only beneficial for the women of these countries, but the environment. It is also a necessity to maintain funding in Planned Parenthood as it is an extremely beneficial resource for women and families. 
             <br><br>

It also shocked me that refrigerant management was the #1 most effective solution for decreasing CO2 emissions because it is something that can be changed easily. When the author of the article stated that "90% of refrigerator emissions happen at the end of its life" I could not believe it. Something so small as HFCs are creating a huge problem for our environment and more people should be aware of it. This article encouraged me to share this information with family and friends and put into practice the solutions presented.

I really like how clear and organized the "Summary of Solutions" is. By listing the solutions and their impacts, the "Summary of Solutions" makes taking action on climate crisis more approachable. I used to feel very overwhelm then I bought about where should I start when it comes to taking actions on climate crisis because there is just so much thing that we should do and I always feel unsure about whether or not what I do can actually make a difference. But this list of solutions really reassures and motivates me that what I do matters.
             <br><br>
I always hear people say that refrigerants are bad for the environment but I never knew how. The "Summary of Solutions" shows me that the current refrigerant HCF has 1.000 to 9,000 times greater capacity to warm the atmosphere than CO2. Also. the disposal of HCF is important because most of the emissions happen at the end of the life of refrigerants. Knowing how refrigerants are detrimental to the environment and what I can to to help is much more helpful that people telling me refrigerants are bad and then leave me clueless about what I can do about it.
             <br><br>

I'm surprised that reducing food waste and having a plant-based diet combined can reduce CO2 emission by 140 gigaton. This is 50 gigaton more than the impact of the number one solution--refrigerant management. This is only the top 2 but not all CO2 contributors from the food sector on the list. So, it is clear that our current way of food consumption is not environmentally friendly. 
             <br><br>

Seeing education of girls and women on the top of the list makes me realize that solving climate crisis requires not only technical advances but also improvements on our society and culture. In China, there are still a lot of people from the less developed part that think women are reproductive tools for the men's family and that the number and gender of the child of a women defines her value. This leads to women keep having children until she gets a boy and even after that, she is still encouraged to have more kids.
             <br><br>

Overall, after reading the "Summary of Solutions", I feel like I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel even though there is a long way to go.

Honestly, this gives me hope as well, especially, because the number one solution (refrigerant management) is so simple. Granted, it is extremely expensive, but I honestly think that given the state and stubbornness of our collective society, that a problem that is fixable by throwing massive amounts of cash at it is more likely to get fixed than one that requires massive societal change. More so, I am confident that this will likely happen because we already did it once with Freon. I am unsure that we will meet the deadline given our current administration, but there is hope.
             <br><br>


Another thing that shocked me is that replacing this simple gas, which I did not even know worsened global warming, has a larger impact than the beef industry. At this point in the course, I feel as if I have a decent amount of knowledge on the climate crisis, at least when compared to the general public and even myself just two months ago. How did I not know this? This should be mainstream, on political campaigns, with demonstrators on the street, why has it taken 6 weeks of this course to even mention this. Yes, the beef industry is the big villain, but it is going to take either a superhero or a massive alliance to defeat them. This we can fix on a ballot. Why aren't we addressing this first. I mean we are so close with this agreement, but given that I have heard nothing of it on a college campus, the heart of activism, I can only assume that momentum is dying down. We cannot let that happen.

I was surprised when reading "Project Drawdown" because as Ken stated, a lot of the things that people are being told to do to decrease their carbon footprint did not make the list. The first item on the list took me by surprise, as I along with many others have never heard how bad the chemicals in a refrigerator are for the planet. The main solutions outlined had to do with food and land use. Food production takes up so much land, and resources so by switching to a planet based diet we are automatically cutting down the amount of carbon emissions emitted into the Earth. Another major thing that we could do to help the planet is stop wasting food. It was crazy reading the difference in food usage between the low and high income countries. In low-income countries, they use up everything where as in high-income countries, we will throw out anything that does not look like and meet the standards of an average whatever the food is. 
              <br><br>
It's layout is very clear and organized and I appreciated how they structured everything, so that it was easy to read.  A lot of the things that we can do to help with the climate crisis are attainable and involve the educating people about the best way to do things. The solution that really stood out to me was the educating of girls. The more educated they are, the less kids they have which will help the environment because that means that there will be less people with a carbon foot print. What this made me wonder, was then why are so many people against abortion, if it gives women autonomy over their own bodies and it saves the planet (and child of hardship).

I was also surprised that the things we do to reduce their carbon footprint aren't really making much of a difference. I think it is rooted in keeping people satisfied with their efforts toward saving the planet with really easy and accessible solutions. However, the real difference comes from making big changes in our way of life, especially in our diet. I've known that becoming vegan or vegetarian at the least can do a lot for helping our environment, but I had previously figured that other changes would be more impactful. Should the high-income countries be less entitled to everything and become more mindful about how their actions affect others and the environment, we wouldn't have nearly as much food waste.

             <br><br>

How he explains what we can do about the population growth to slow it down gives me a lot of hope. Although it would take time for institutional changes to become widespread, I have much optimism that we can achieve our goals to educate more women on family planning. It also makes me wonder about the politics behind abortion laws, what the real motive behind it is.

<p>
In Project Drawdown's Summary of Solutions, I was pleased to see that there are many possible solutions to help save the climate and alternatives to our current technologies. The most surprising statistic however, was that if we were to switch to a plant-based diet, we could save an estimated $1 TRILLION in ANNUAL health care costs. Our current diet comprises an astounding 1/5th of global green house gas emissions. Another surprising dietary statistic was that over 8% of global emissions are from food we don't even end up eating. These solutions among others were both surprising to read and somewhat frustrating that we aren't doing something about this given that we know all of the damage we are causing and have all of the data to support it. If we can switch our focus to prioritize saving the environment over saving money then maybe we can get somewhere with the climate crisis.

I wholeheartedly agree with your statement about prioritizing the environment over money and I really wish that everyone especially those in power had the same motives. Although there are several things everyday people like you and I can do to help mitigate the crisis, we won’t make big change until the system changes. The bright side is that through doing things like eating largely plant-based and minimizing overall material consumption we can show our values and what direction we want our economy to move towards. As you mentioned, eating plant-based could save a trillion dollars in health-care costs, so, even if someone isn’t directly worried about the climate crisis and cares about money more, they could still see the financial and economic benefits here.

I personally appreciate this list. As an environmental studies major, I often get questions from relatives like “what can I do?” When I then launch into the long list of what people can do as consumers, voters, and community members, they stop me and say things like “I’m never gonna remember all of this” or “yeah but I don’t have time for all of those things what’s the most important?”. Almost inevitably, they lament that someone should write a book about how to save the planet. I will henceforth direct them to project drawdown.
             <br><br>

Though it’s not a complete step by step manual on how to be environmentally responsible (wouldn’t it be a wonderful world if being a good environmentalist, citizen, person etc. could be boiled down into 200 pages), it is a fantastic starting point. While some solutions draw more heavily on collective, governmental influence than individual action, I believe in the power of the individual to affect the collective, especially in a democracy. What’s great about this list is it actually shows you how effective each solution would be in terms of the greenhouse gases avoided.
             <br><br>

I was, like many people, surprised to see refrigerant management so high at the top of the list. But what really struck me was how important food waste is. As someone who loves to eat, this made me very happy because I now have a strong moral argument for eating any leftovers I find in the fridge

I thought it was really effective that the "impact" sections would mention the net savings and highlight that a lot of these sustainable actions are actually going to save people money. A lot of people seem to be under the impression that sustainable options will be more expensive and hurt the economy, but there are ways to prevent this and the figures are very convincing. Although some things, like Concentrated Solar are very expensive at 1.3 trillion, they will eventually save enough to make up for that. Also, some of the ways to reduce carbon emissions, like the Educating Girls section, are things that people can get behind even if they are not super interested in environmental issues since it is an issue regarding human rights that happens to also greatly affect the environment. This emphasizes the fact that if you are not fighting to help the environment then you are not doing what is in the best interest of the human race as a whole.
             <br><br>

I found it important that Project Drawdown noted the fact that "bringing about diet change is not simple because eating is profoundly personal and cultural". The idea of everyone transitioning to a vegan diet has not always sat well with me because I know that restricting what you eat can lead to disordered eating and some people use a vegan diet as an excuse to cut calories and eat less. I realize that this is only a small issue in the grand scheme of things, but for some people this is a very important thing to take into account. Thus, it would be crucial to educate people better on nutrition and how to practice a vegan lifestyle in a healthy way, especially for athletes who need a lot of protein.
             <br><br>

Overall, I found it kind of relieving to see all the things that can be done to save the planet and how easy some of them are. This list needs to be spread more so that others can be more informed on what they can do at an individual and collective level.

I also thought it was really effective how they incorporated how much it would cost to invest in these solutions and also the net savings because people often stray away from seeking alternative-sustainable solutions due to how much it would cost them. In the society we live in today, I feel like profit is the only thing a lot of people care about. They are under the impression that since they are already making profit with their way now, why should they change? I also found the section regarding the education of girls important because like you said, in order to address environmental issues, we must also look at human rights and how depriving them of these given rights are only going to further lead us down a more detrimental path for our environment. 
             <br><br>


You bring up a really important point also regarding vegan diets and how people often adopt it as a way to eat less and cut calories and how it often leads to disordered eating habits. But I also think that as we transition into influencing people into eating a plant-based diet, we need to also educate them on how to have a well balanced diet while eating plant based. It will enable us to possibly see a future in which eating meat is no longer the norm. When we look at society today, there are many people who go vegan, however there really isn’t a guide on how to be vegan. There isn’t a lot of information or recipes that are available and accessible simply because of how eating meat has been so deeply engraved into our cultures. 
             <br><br>
Reading all of the solutions proposed in this week's reading kind of gave a sense of hope that maybe our generation will do something in order to reverse the damage that is being done to our planet. Some of these solutions start by individual behavior changes. So change starts with us is crucial if we want to create long-lasting change for generations to come.

Reading "project drawback" was really interesting because I didn't realize how much carbon dioxide emissions were caused by refrigerants. I thought that a big contribution to help solve the climate crisis would be veganism. I enjoyed how detailed the list is, and various topics covered are helpful to people with different lifestyles. 
<br><br>
This reading was definitely different from the usual readings for the class. It was more of an informative list, and I really appreciate the simplistic format of the piece.

Adding to your comment, the reading really was a contrast to most we have done so far! In the past we have seen multiple articles describing the solutions as a result of an issue and centering it on that, however the article really showcased an amazing amount of ways to reduce our carbon footprint in such a concise list. "Project drawback" was such a refreshing read as it really helped show its readers why they should reduce their emissions and provide a good amount of solutions that they could pick from.

After watching this video, I was surprised to learn that refrigerant management is the most important thing we can do as a society to combat climate change. I have been learning about global warming and climate change since middle school and for some reason was never taught this. Is this because it is something that there is no current solution for? I’ve always known that agriculture, housing, and transportation were huge methods for the ordinary person to lower their carbon footprint, yet I was not aware that it was refrigeration that trumped everything else. Or was refrigerant management included in the housing category?
             <br><br>

What current steps are being taken to help lower refrigerant emissions? Will the solution come from technological advancements in refrigeration technology or will the solution stem from the humanities and lifestyle change?

I was also surprised when I saw that the biggest contributer to global warming is refrigerator management.  I have heard all  of the other calls to action: go vegan, go solar, stop wasting food, stop wasting energy.  I have heard that air conditioning is bad for the environment, but I always thought it was just a minor aspect.  Now I am wondering why we have not heard this complaint?  Is it because air conditioning companies are lobbying to keep this out of the mouths of policymakers?  Or, would it be too inconvenient for people to stop using air conditioning?

             <br><br>

This seems like a perfect market to disrupt.  As you asked, What steps are being taken to reduce the emissions given off by refrigerants?  While I have not looked into it, I have not heard of a great alternative to AC and refrigerators.  As a costal Californian, it seems as if we could all drop AC as it is not needed, but a replacement for a refrigerator would be more work.  A good alternative could be an ice chest, how they used to do it.  Or we could buy food on a daily basis instead of a weekly basis.  This would then require to plan cities better so that could be a possibility.   The more I write, the more I realize that our society is completely reliant on a lot of things that are destructive to our environment, from how we cool our food to how we plan our cities.

I found Project Drawdown to be the most comprehensive plan proposed to lower our carbon emissions in our personal lives and collectively as society. I think that  every person should consider some of these proposals on this website. It is shocking to me that the top three solutions alone would do more to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions than the bottom 75 combined. I did not expect that phasing out HFCs in refrigeration and air condition units to take the number on spot on this list. If  the Kigali accord finds itself successful, then by 2050, we can expect our carbon emissions to be reduced by 89.74 gigatons. 
             <br><br>

Taking the second spot on the list is wind turbines. Just an increase in onshore wind from 3 to 4 percent  of world electricity to 21.6 percent by 2050 could reduce emissions by 84.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide. I don’t understand why we aren’t prioritizing building more wind turbine farms, it seems to be a much better alternative than coal- generated electricity. Wind energy is soon to be the least expensive source of electricity with the added benefits that it has no fuel costs and no pollution. 
             <br><br>

I knew that our society wasted a lot of food, but not to this extent. It’s shocking to me that the food we waste is responsible for around eight percent of global emissions. There is no reason that one third of our food raised or prepared does not even reach our tables. 1 in 7 people do not have enough food to lead a healthy active life, but here  we are wasting a third of our food. If we waste less food, we can put a significantly less amount of methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. 
             <br><br>

I appreciate the fact that Professor Hiltner assigned this reading to us. I think it is imperative that everyone in a first country world take a look at these proposals. There are many easy and simple solutions that we can all integrate into our lives.

I learned a lot of new information about how to reduce the world's impact on the climate from this article. I was definitely surprised by the order of some of the solutions considering I haven’t even heard about some of the most effective solutions. It seems that there are a lot of personal solutions that we can make like simply buying a more energy efficient refrigerator and reducing the amount of meat we consume and food we waste. By being more mindful of our lifestyle and consumer choices we could potentially reduce your personal carbon footprint by a half. The rest of the bigger change must come from more global solutions. We need to find ways to better educate women who do not have access to information about family planning and the impacts of climate change. Statistically more educated women have fewer children serving to benefit the ongoing issue of over population growth and its effects on the environment.

This reading was probably the most informative one to date and one I found very interesting. I liked how the reading was simple,  easy to read and had great advice for solutions. This was a reading I found useful as most of these solutions can be done by me. In past lectures I felt discouraged about how some of the solutions involved giving up things I loved like eating meat, or not flying as often, but some of the solutions listed here are very doable and accessible. Some of these solutions were ones I was already educated on such as reducing food waste, family planning, or changing our food diet to a plant based one. However, I found a lot of these potential solutions very surprising. Refrigerant management was one I didn’t expect to be on here, especially at the highest rank. I didn’t know they had such a great impact on the environment and have never heard of it being a massive contributor to the climate crisis. This reading though educated me on a lot of these matters. I also found it intriguing how it mentioned that 170 countries met to address this issue, seeing how many countries participate in this act. One problem that I found concerning though was the land use of tropical forests. It alarmed me to read that due to destruction tropical forests only make up 5% of the world’s landmass. Tropical forests play a huge role in our environment, and it is great to hear that there is already a restoration process. Lastly, cookstoves was another issue I didn't expect to see and especially read that these practices make up 2-5% of greenhouse emissions.

I think it's crazy how uninformed we are about the sources of atmospheric pollutants. For such a long time all we've heard about is the burning of fossil fuels when there is so much more going on, Just lack week a lot of us were surprised to see the real damage fast fashion does to the environment and now we have to embrace the fact that the way we eat is the real problem and one of the only problems that we can directly take part in. We people have the power to reduce emissions by consuming less food and especially less animals and animal produced products. By watching the way we consume we lower the demand of all farm-based produce and we target the main issue. Not only that but reducing the demand of produce reduces the amount of land we use for agricultural practices and then there's no need for deforestation and our forests would thrive the way they're supposed to. After reading the top 25 solutions of Project Drawdown I was surprised to see that a lot of these solutions revolve around food meaning that we don't have to wait on fossil fuel industries to stop burning coal and extracting oil, although that is what we want, but we can address the issue of climate change ourselves by changing our DIET. Something so simple yet so hard to do. Why ? I've thought about this and it might sound silly but I think it's hard for a lot of people to change the way they eat, especially when it comes to meat because it's so good, it gives pleasure to our sense of taste and releases dopamine into the brain and it turns it into this kind of addiction that we can't turn away from. It's insane. It's something we all have to do though. Addictions aren't just associated with drugs we all know that, but no type of addiction is healthy and our addiction to meat and meat-based products certainly isn't. It's going to be really hard to get people to not only understand the impact agricultural and livestock practices have on the climate and the overall health of the planet but also to inspire them to take action. If people were to change, it would inspire other people to at least try but for people to start changing they need to know that the main issue is the emissions produced from plant and livestock production and that they are the solution. We need to educate each other and work towards this goal. whether that's likely to happen... I don't know but I'm hopeful. We need people to see that consuming less meat and meat-based products is a good thing, not a punishment.

After reading the work from project drawdown, it became quickly apparent that their were two primary categorizations for which the largest climate impact could be had: food production and energy. Our over consumption of meat and our desire for the same types of foods all-year have led to vast amounts of land being misused or over farmed. This effectively destroys the land, as the land is never given time to recover or rotated with crops which could fix those issues. Particularly, I found the “Tropical Staple Trees” to be quite interesting, as I did not realize that such a simple and low-cost option was available for utilization of current land. I hope that we can move towards more of these solutions at a significantly faster pace.

I agree with your statement about moving towards more of these solutions at a faster pace.  The fact that someone out there has taken the time to make such comprehensive solutions for such specific problems in the way we consume food and produce energy within our everyday lives, we would be negligent to not implement these solutions.  I found it particularly interesting myself that something that seems simple like refrigerator maintenance could release significant amounts of CO2 gas or the harmful waste that comes from a refrigerator alone.  It's ridiculous that things like "changing your lightbulb" is so emphasized in the discussion of climate change solutions when it's not even significantly effective nor mentioned in the Project Drawdown's summary of solutions.

It was nice being assigned a reading that gave a broad overview of different solutions to help fix the climate crisis. It’s amazing to read how there are certain things we have already done that have led to legal change such as the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which dealt with CFCs and HCFCs that deplete the ozone layer. In part of the reading, it mentioned a wind farm, which I believe is an area of wind turbines all around. If I am wrong, can someone please correct me. I was completely shocked that ⅓ of the food raised or prepared doesn’t make it from the farm/factory to our plates. Originally, when I saw the header “reduced goof waste,” I thought it would only be talking about not throwing away our food too much or getting excessive amounts of food to the point where it’s impossible to eat everything before one of those items spoils. How could I have not thought of the role of the infrastructure for storage, processing, and transportation might factor into this. Food waste is 8% of our global emissions, and in my opinion, there isn’t a hard change to shift that number down. I knew going vegan or vegetarian would help with the reduction of emissions, however I did not know it was high as a 70% and 63% reduction. Unfortunately, we are losing a lot of the Tropical Forests, the fact that we went from 12% to 5% of the world’s landmass is insane. Education is important, not only for it’s academic knowledge, but also for its real life knowledge. Education gives women the knowledge on birth control methods and family planning, which allow women to have fewer and healthier children. Before the reading, I did not know the difference between PV and CSP. From my understanding of the reading the difference there’s something about steam turbines and this idea of using solar radiation rather than coal or natural gas as CSP’s primary fuel. If someone could explain the difference better, that would be very much appreciated.

The way I had learned about CFC’s and HFC’s was that CFC’s were the bad guy causing a hole in our ozone layer, but that HFC’s were the good guy that replaced them and let us continue on living. It was taught like this in my ES 1 class that I took last year. We discussed the ozone layer hole as a climate issue, how it was caused (CFC’s) and how it was solved with an easily available and viable replacement (HFC’s). I was under no impression that there was a problem with this replacement until this reading. Why hasn’t there been any news regarding this issue? Or even announcements of the results of the Kigali Accord - which by the way I didn’t even know existed! Are there companies that want to stop this information from getting out? I know that there are massive meat industry lobbyists and meat companies that have a stronghold in our government, but is this the case with these refrigerants? How can this information be out there and this is the first time I’m hearing of it?! Clearly I am shocked and not having an easy time processing this. 
               <br><br>
  I am conscious of what I eat and do my best to aim for food waste reduction, which are all great and clearly as this list shows can have a large impact, but I am really now concerned with the refrigerant management issue that I didn’t know we were facing. Like many others have said, this reading was overall uplifting to see how much hope there is in order to reduce our environmental impact. I actually have to say that I think this was the most informational reading we’ve had thus far. As a result though, it means that this new issue has come to light for me and it is now another one that I will be extremely weary of.

This weeks reading was one of the most encouraging because after reading the top 25 things we can do to mitigate the crisis, some can be easily done by everyday people. Just by lowering the amount of air conditioning we use, and by lessening our refrigeration usage, those are largely habits that we can do. When we read or talk about climate change and it’s drastic effects it typically feels like such a large issue that the common person can come to even affecting. But reading that our diet habits CAN contribute a change to the current crisis, it feels so good to have at least maybe some control over a seemingly existential Truly sends the message to us that there are “easy” ways to lessen our carbon footprint, and with those small steps, the larger ones don’t seem so daunting.

Project Drawdown surprised me in the numerous amount of ways to combat climate change with the potential gigatons of CO2 reduction. Most of these solutions correlated with agriculture and farmland and it made me realize how much of our environment is abused in order to produce food for our consumption. From large biomasses like the amazon and temperate forests, there are so many areas in our world that are able to hold in carbon so it doesn't convert to CO2. I can’t believe that the destruction of these parts is not only bad for our atmosphere, but it also hurts the land for farming. This just shows me that the agricultural industry doesn’t care about the quality of their work; they only work towards producing the fastest and most yield no matter the consequences.

I really liked this week's reading as it gave me some sense of hope for the future. In contrast to the previous articles that provided a bleak outcome and explained in detail to what degree the earth is doomed, this article gives examples of realistic solutions that can be implemented. Although these solutions are not easy nor the ultimate fix to the climate crisis, they can give us more time to make bigger changes. This type of information promotes a more planet friendly mentality without the 'stigma' that drastic solutions that can  truthfully create more problems that make many people shun the idea of climate change. The adoption of this mentality is, in my opinion, the key to tackling climate change.
               <br><br>


To further elaborate: the way the solutions are structured and summarized are important in tackling the 'I'd rather ignore the realities of climate change' mentality that a lot of individuals (including myself) have a propensity of having. A lot of people avoid discussing the climate crisis as many solutions are simply unrealistic in this day and age to implement: such as phasing out all car and airplane travel and cutting out all meat from our diets. Personally, when people present solutions of those nature to me I have a tendency of thinking that they are not living in reality and I tend to ignore the real underlying message. Having a list of realistic solutions along with the emissions reduction, price of implementation and longterm economic benefit definitely made me take the cause more seriously. If a politician brought this form of mentality to tackling the climate crisis instead of 'we are going to have 0 emissions' rhetoric, my chances of voting for them would be significantly higher.
               <br><br>


The real fight is to change people's mind about the issue. That's how big oil changed the let's get green mindset in the past couple of years.

Elyes, I do like how you talked about this reading was more optimistic in nature, because there is solutions in this reading instead of being only pessimistic about the future. With all these solutions, there is potential we can have a better tomorrow and turn the tide in the war of the climate crisis. I also loved how the eased in nature with the solutions, as I can see how many Americans fear the drastic change of life. As Ken usually discusses in lecture, eventually there will have to be drastic changes such as almost no airplane travel. But this solution actually comes desirable and somewhat convincing as benefits are given to the reader. All it takes is facts of how things can change for the better for people to be persuaded. Logos is one of the most powerful forms of persuasion, which many big oil companies use. But one thing climate vanguards can do, is use Pathos. There can be emotion used to sway people, such as not changing ways and methods of life that are harmful to the environment can lead to earth dying prematurely. With this, people cannot see their own grandkids grow up and have the life they deserve.


<br><hr>
Elyes, I completely agree. I think that many people are turned off from environmentalism because they think it means being plant-based or only biking everywhere, which is completely fine with some people, but definitely not easy for everyone. The reality is, many people need to find solutions that work with their lifestyles. I feel as though having the approach of forcing solutions onto people only turns people away from helping, and discourages them from making any changes at all. I really liked how this article was more positive, as I think many people, including people in this course based on the comments, tend to feel helpless and lose hope in even trying to help the environment. Because of this, I agree that this type of outlook is much more optimistic and more encouraging. Having zero emissions just isn't possible, and I think its much more impactful to focus on what we can do as individuals instead of forcing an agenda that everyone must follow.

After reading the solutions by Project Drawdown, I found this is the most interesting and clear reading I have done so far in this course. It helps me focus on the detailed solutions as an individual rather than a collective. To be honest, now I become somehow more optimistic and confident about the future of the climate change. I realize that many of these solutions and concepts have been covered in the lecture. On the other hand, many of the solutions of the top 25 in this list could only be got by changing the system that we currently have. As Ken mentioned in his video, the changes that we can do as individuals are only be around one-tenth of the change that we could get out of something as big as reducing our food waste. Also, I think its significant to get more and more girls educated, since girls have the same ability to make changes as boys.

It’s amazing how we can all contribute to the reduction of global warming. Homemade solutions to the reduction of carbon emissions are a great start that can be done by each person. First and foremost, we should strive to reduce vehicle emissions as they are a big contributor to global warming. The solutions provided are very unique and provide us with the chance to come up with better methods of dealing with global warming. It should all start from the household. Land use and food and electricity use are the biggest contributors and can be implemented through change in the way we conduct ourselves. 
               <br><br>

Regeneration and restoration of green forms of energy can help deal with the top contributors. Emissions of hydrocarbons should be mitigated by all countries where it’s important to understand the carbon footprints. Managing food waste is an interesting prospect as I am also a contributor to this action. Plant based diets is good as most of the foods are biodegradable. Less meat is a good start and we need to adopt the small changes at home. We need to educate each and every one on the importance of dealing with climate change through small but effective changes.

Project Drawdown really opened my eyes to ways I could cut down on my personal carbon footprint. I remember when I was about 7 years old and I had left the fridge open while I brought out food for me and my friends, but did not think much of it. My aunt who was visiting at the time told me that I was wasting energy which is contributing to global warming and melting the ice caps. That moment was when I really developed an environmental consciousness because I loved Polar Bears and she said they would lose their habitats and become extinct if I kept wasting energy. This class and English 22 has not only made me more aware of this climate crisis but has prompted me to take personal action at a whole new level. Eleven out of the twenty-five solutions stated were related to land use and food. Most people when they buy food do not take into consideration how their food got to where it was. Tons of carbon dioxide and methane are released into the atmosphere during its production and transportation to where you consume it last. If the whole planet could switch to a mainly plant-based, locally grown diet, then we could drastically cut down on carbon emissions. Many of these solutions listed will in the end also save money. Money is what makes this world go around which is sad because that is why many of these new forms of energy cannot be tried at a larger scale. The bottom line is the new generations need to be continued to be educated like Ken said in the video in order to keep our population aware of what we need to do and to give women all over the world safe ways to have a planned family. The solutions are presented and it’s now time to take action.

I also agree that this article provided lots of hope and optimism regarding our climate crisis. Many of the solutions are very obtainable and require simple changes to our daily lives. On the other hand, some are more extensive and will require bigger changes and more investment. These changes will probably not happen all at once, but it is important to have goals to strive for as well as be able to do something right now that will make a big impact.
                <br><br>

The money saving aspect of many of these solutions intrigued me as well. I believe that as a society, alternative and sustainable energy sources like solar are becoming way more affordable. As the website mentioned, there are still high costs surrounding the installation of solar, but overall it is really important the cost is decreasing.  This is very important because it encourages more people to utilize these methods and allows people making less money to utilize these options as well. I think it is really cool that there are many money driven incentives given to households that utilize solar. The incentives slightly balance out the large upfront cost associated with technology like this. I think if these incentives were given for other things such as using more public transportation or purchasing electric bikes, these practices will become more widespread as well.

I am so happy we finally got to solutions. While I understand that in order to address the crisis you have to establish inherency and show the dire nature of the status quo, but it was truly relieving to move on from the doom and gloom. Over the course of this class, I have often felt like I am just re-learning information, but, looking at Project Drawdown, I realised how much I've learned by my lack of surprise at everything on the list and the order in which they are ranked. I shared it with a lot of my highschool friends who are environmentally inclined. They were pretty stunned on how terrible cars and housing is for the environment, but based on what I've learned in this class, I was not shocked at all. The fact the top several solutions are more effective than the rest combined is astounding however, because if we all just did 5 things differently, sacrificing a little bit of convenience, we could get emissions under control, only involving individuals changing their own behavior. The simplicity and weight of these behaviors is incredible, and once again I find I have some hope restored for the future of humanity, albeit just a little

I completely agree with the points that you have made. The more positive vantage point on the issue of climate change is also relieving for me. I am truly astounded by the creative perspective of these solutions and the logical thought implemented for each motion. This gives me hope in the actions of climate change activists. The resourcefulness of these actions make me feel as if there is absolutely no excuse for anyone not to participate in mitigating climate change, regardless of where they live and stand. I have also shared some of these solutions to my family, and they are really happy about the potential of this planet experiencing a positive environmental turn around. I think realistically it would be reasonable to expect that our planet’s inhabitants can be slightly inconvenienced and find other environmentally conscious choices that would be satisfactory in their normal routines.

This week’s reading is somehow different from the readings we did for the previous weeks. “Project Drawdown” provided various solutions to save our planet. Instead of being dense and making people feel so reluctant to read, this article is organized into a list with different categories listed next to the solutions; it’s very helpful for me to group those solutions and understand how each plan works. After reading this article, I felt that every single of them is doable and definitely will help. I’m also happy to see there’s one plan called “educating girls” because I know girls’ education is an issue that is still being ignored in many areas all over the world. People probably haven’t realized how important education is for the climate issues, especially the education for females. They are the ones who breed and raise our next generation. As Ken talked before, population control is vital for slowing down climate changes; and the more educated the women are, the less children they will have since they are more likely to get married later than those who are not well-educated. What’s more, I enjoy reading the summary part of each solution because it gives a clear idea about how we should make it happen to the readers. These detailed summaries made the article more convincing and appealing than those articles just giving our big words and theories.

I definitely agree that this week's reading was really good at giving you the facts while not having an information overload. I for one have a really short attention span and can get distracted really easily so the fact that this was all condensed into very short paragraphs was super helpful.

I liked how Ken described Project Rundown as a roadmap to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. The list lays out for us, in order, the most major contributions to the climate crisis and what we need to correct in order to start saving our planet. It was crazy to me that number one on the list was something I never considered as a major issue, or even an issue at all. Our refrigerators and air conditioners are major sources of warming and just by effectively recycling or disposing of them, according to this list, we are well on our way to beating this crisis. I was also surprised that so much of the list was related to land use. It emphasized how important it is to use the space on Earth effectively and in ways best for our environment. Silvopastures, regenerative and conservative agriculture, tree intercropping and other items on that list aim to reduce carbon emissions from our agriculture and feature so many additional benefits for our planet. Just being smart about our land use is clearly crucial after reading this list. Not leaving farmed land to waste or deforested areas behind, but instead restoring these environments can have tremendous benefits. This can also carry into our energy production. Instead of damaging areas to place coal-based energy sources, we can use rooftops for solar panels or off coast wind turbines. Population is another major problem that comes up in most of the films we watch and articles we read. Our population is becoming, or already is, much too large for the planet to handle. Education for both men and women should be a requirement in order to prevent unplanned pregnancies. It was insane to learn 45 percent of pregnancies in the United States are unintended. Food waste is also huge, and I found it interesting that in high-income areas we willingly dispose of food, but in low-income regions the food waste issue occurs earlier on and is not a choice.

I really liked the list of ways that we can limit or reduce our carbon emissions and greenhouse gases. They provided quite a bit of data on solutions and it was very overwhelming. It was also stressful thinking about the little things we've been taught to do such as unplugging chargers and turning off lights and seeing how little that actually reduces our impact on the atmosphere. It was also shocking to hear that all of this can be for nothing if we drive our cars for more than a second, which we obviously do. 
                <br><br>

Because of facts like this, it is easy to see how many people are discouraged about climate change and don't think that anything they do will help or hurt too much. This is somewhat true, but imagine if everyone took the same stance. Or took that same stance on something else, such as littering. Sure one person littering isn't a huge deal, it's one piece of trash. But if everyone did that same thing our earth would be disgusting.

In previous readings and lectures, we learned that individual actions can have a profound impact on the environment, but also that it must be joined with government efforts as well in order for there to be any hope of solving the issue. Project Drawdown offers a comprehensive and insightful plan into what we can do as a collective, and what we can ask our leaders and politicians to do.
                <br><br>

I was very surprised to learn that 1/3 of the food produced are thrown away just because they don't look attractive or conform to industry standards. We have always been taught to not judge people by their looks and to embrace diversity in beauty, so why not have the same mindset when it comes to food? I came across this website called Imperfect Foods while listening to a podcast; it's a delivery service that deliver curated produce (that can also be customized) to you at a super discounted price because those foods are deemed as "ugly" by the industry. Imagine how much money you can save and how much of an impact it would have on the reducing carbon emissions if all those foods are used up!
                <br><br>

Another thing that stands out to me in this reading was that government subsidies distort pricing to benefit the U.S. livestock industry. One question that really bothered me for a long time was that, if the raising livestocks, especially beef, is so much more resource extensive than raising crops, then why is is that vegan burger patties are so much more expensive that the regular ones, and non-dairy yogurt so much more expensive than regular yogurt? This reading explains a lot. I feel like pricing is such an important aspect of it too, because when you go grocery shopping, even though the vegan option is only higher for a dollar, you know what in the long run it will cost you a lot of money, so why not just stick with the regular option?

I agree that Project Drawdown offers a fantastic array of solutions to politicians and government leaders. The main excuse for not taking action to resolve climate crisis,  other than the offensive argument made by climate change deniers, is that no true solution can be decided upon. But Project Drawdown creates the option for government officials of many small solutions can be enacted to create a large effect via the sum of their impacts. Even if the first three solutions were implemented, a change in refrigeration, wind energy, and food waste, the effect would be grand and important. Additionally, with each of these solutions carefully summarized, they are easy to understand and more approachable when considering implementing them into one's real life. Even without political action regarding these solutions, if those in power were to advocate for the changes suggested by Project Drawdown, I believe environmental improvement could be made. 
                <br><br>

I have to say that your allusion to society not judging by looks does not translate well, in my opinion. Of course, a judgement free world is an aspiration we can all appreciate, but realistically it is more difficult to achieve. It is innate in human nature that people gravitate towards perfection, if you offer a child the choice between a new doll or a used, worn one, it is obvious which one would be chosen. The same can be said for foods, a bright red apple is much more appealing than a bruised one. It is a harmful, consumerist tendency to expect food to appear perfect and fresh as other shopping products do. If food were to be produced by each individual for themselves, individual agriculture would produce food much less appealing than the bruised produce we leave behind in the grocery store.
                <br><br>

And finally, a response to expensive veganism: I read an article this morning about sustainable pigeon steak being used to result in less beef usage. That seems to be a weird but promising solution. No way pigeon meat could be more than beef. But expensive alternatives to meat? It does make sense when considering supply and demand: there's not as much so it's more expensive. But once a big change is enacted, prices should reduce. Starbucks just recently announced that they plan to shift entirely away from dairy products, and that in doing so they predict an entire market reduction in the price of dairy alternatives due to the new demand their company will create. I love the idea of this monopoly company making such a big change that offers such an environmentally friendly impact, and hope it will inspire similar largely spanning companies to follow suit.

This reading made me realize that we really don’t have an excuse for still continuously destroying the planet. We are too smart for this. The brains in our society have already set a roadmap for saving our planet. Prioritization and efficiency is important. This reading informs us of the primary steps that we can take in making a big impact in reducing our CO2 emissions.
                 <br><br>
I am not surprised that CFCs and HCFCs are the priority solutions since these gases are thousand times more potent in absorbing heat than CO2. I was more surprised that switching to plant based diets are actually 10 times more efficient than switching to an electric car. These kinds of solutions are very effective but are also difficult to do as a collective. For years we have gotten used to this kind of lifestyle and with time passing we just keep improving the appliances that we don’t really need but are just making life a little bit more mechanical and easier if you may. Effectively purifying and reusing refrigerants is key because it can create a huge impact. This kind of information should be talked about more. Before reading this, I didn’t even know that it is possible for refrigerants to be purified for reuse or transformed into other chemicals that do not cause warming.
                <br><br>
Lastly, awareness is important when living our daily lives. Reducing your carbon footprint might not seem like a lot of reduction compared to refrigerant management, but small things like that when employed by the collective will build up and not just reduce CO2 as a community but also stir a culture of aware and engaged citizens. Who knows? Maybe telling your younger siblings to unplug their phone chargers when not used will lead them to ask questions and start being a solution themselves.

I agree with much of your comment. I am also surprised at the fact that we have all these alternatives for energy and travel and yet we choose not to use it. I believe much like you said we have to inform the general public of these alternatives and of our daily impact to the environment. I also believe though, that much of the reason as to why we don' t know much about these alternatives or we aren't really exposed to them is because of big businesses. Huge corporations today are greatly dependent on fossil fuels and ways that emit much carbon emissions and they will do everything in their power to stop any talk or exposure of ways in which can harm their profit. For example, I am sure the meat industry would like people and or public advertisement of eating more plant based diets and leaving the meat industry and factory farming behind. Of course this is just one of the factors in why we don't know much about carbon emissions and why they are not in place. I believe just like you that we should educate the public about these harms that we are causing and also provide them with the information and tools to help their transition to a more environmentally friendly life style.


<br><hr>
I agree with you. I don’t understand how there are so many people unaware of the impact that these solutions will have on our planet. If we are able to think of these solutions and ways to implement them, how have people in power not decided to act. I think Project Drawdown needs to be viewed by everyone, especially those with power in our system. These solutions are proven to bring CO2 emissions down significantly within the next few decades. I like how they include their two scenarios and how the data would change for both. Their top three solutions are reduced food waste, health and education, and plant-rich diets, which is amazing considering how we’ve been told our entire lives that we should just stop using plastic, turn off our lights when not using them, and using more efficient appliances in our houses. Those solutions are simply not enough to stop the climate crisis. We need a system change that will enforce the actions that need to be taken to save our planet, starting with the three most important solutions given by project drawdown. 
                 <br><br>
I believe that reducing food waste and providing women with better health and education services can be done, albeit with quite a bit of persuading. Making people switch to plant-rich diets seems like the most difficult to achieve since there are so many people who refuse to follow that lifestyle or depend on meat as their main food source. I’ve argued with my family multiple times about how important this lifestyle change is for the environment, but they are stubbornly holding on to their belief that no harm is being done by the meat industry. While living a vegan/vegetarian lifestyle is becoming somewhat of a trend, the number is not significant enough to solve our issues. 
                 <br><br>
Making this project known and educating the public about how impactful these solutions would be should be made a priority.

Like the rest of the class, I found this list to be both educational and inspiring. The most surprising was the fact that managing refrigeration is the MOST effective thing we can do to stop climate change. However, the one that I want to focus my comment on was the one regarding Tropical Rainforests. As mentioned in the study, the rainforest cover has decreased from 12% of land cover to 5%. One of the solutions mentioned by ProjectDrawdown was to release land from commercial use. Upon first inspection it might seem like this is only something that a foreign government can do considering that we don’t have any tropical forests in the US. However, that is actually not the case. Almost all of the deforestation that is taking place across the globe is done by multinational agricultural corporations based in...you guessed it… The United States. These corporations, in pursuit of profit, have destroyed up to 80% of Indonesia’s forest habitat and millions of hectares in other regions as well. Since almost all of this destruction is traced back to the United States, you might wonder why we haven’t done anything to stop it. The main reason is that it is profitable. These forests are destroyed in order to get palm oil that these companies sell in the US. And because it is used in things from cosmetics to girl scout cookies, there is a huge demand for it. And who cares if entire ecosystems are destroyed because we get girl scout cookies, right? Well, at least that's how the government sees it anyway. However, the one upside to having a completely immoral economic system is that it can be used to the consumer's advantage. Monsanto and Butterball and all the other agribusinesses only destroy these rainforests because they know that people will continue to purchase the products. On the flip side, if we, as consumers, were to stop purchasing these products, it would no longer be profitable to continue extracting these resources. Since the businesses have no morals, the only way to change their behavior is through boycotts. I encourage everyone to look up what products contain palm oil and try to avoid purchasing them.

I was also surprised by the fact that Refrigerant Management tops all the other issues I learned in and outside of this class. The ban following HFCs’ destruction of ozone layer made me think that they were only harmful towards the ozone layer and there were no side effects prior to reading Project DrawDown. You made a very good point about how corporate greed is destroying tropical forests internationally. I agree with you and I believe this issue should definitely be taken more seriously: not only are tropical forests carbon sinks crucial for combating climate change, they also are habitats with remarkable biodiversity and spices richness. By destroying these tropical forests, the corporates are directly affecting the capacity of the carbon sink the forests act as and indirectly accelerating species extinction as well as destroying ecological services that these forests provide. Boycotting on a personal level is a good start, but regulations should be established internationally to prevent excessive clearing of tropical forests. I also wonder why the Indonesian government has allowed these corporates to clear out the majority of their forests in their own back yard.

<br><hr>
I find it absolutely insane that the most effective way to cut down Co2 emissions is to manage our refrigerators. I have learned that at the end of a refrigerators battery/life, it releases a bunch of chemicals which get released into the atmosphere. I really enjoyed how you included the Tropical Rainforests because I believe our forests are highly important on our planet due to all the wildlife, nature and climate. I would like to add that as well as deforestation happening by multinational agricultural corporations, there is also a film called, “How to Let Go of the World and Love All the Things Climate Can't Change,”  which states that their their is an ecosystems collapse because of beetles demolishing 83 million acres of trees which produces an enormous amount of fuel leading to fires because of the dry climate they are creating. It sucks how our forests are getting destroyed due to the overproduction of beetles because of global warming and corporations are using deforestation in order to make profit from palm oil. I do find it amazing how much palm oil is needed. This idea of profit goes back to the idea of consumerism in the United States. We are not minimalists, we love to gain as much profit in order to spend it on new and expensive things each week. Having hope is the most important factor in order for others to be inspired and determined to make a change in their lifestyle. We need to realize that our habits and money-filled mindset is truly affecting our climate.



<br><hr>
I find your comment extremely insightful and I agree 100% with your position. I find the fact that American corporations are so largely involved in the deforestation of rainforests overseas very devastating, seeing as a country the US was founded to prevent the exploitation of others but has done nothing but the opposite in its history.  As you mentioned however, these corporations thrive due to the public support through profit given to the companies by consumers buying their products that were made by exploiting these endangered areas. Consumers, in general, need to be more aware of the ingredients in these products and have to go even further to research if these ingredients were sustainably harvested. This reminds of a topic I discussed in my senior year Spanish class about sustainable agriculture and the influence the United States has on the palm oil industry. As a result of the horrors caused through the deforestation in areas such as Indonesia for palm oil, a small environmental group created an app that allowed for consumers to scan barcodes which would run the product through a data base and make the consumer aware of the sustainability of the product. I'm not sure if the app ever got passed through the beta phase and actually made it on the market, but I feel as if this could be a great innovation that would allow for consumers to take role in this side of the environmental crisis.

I'm glad that you mentioned the statistics on the rainforest cover, and how the study mentions that it has fallen to 5%. I would also just like to point out that not only has it dropped by that much already, but this study was also done a while ago. If you look at all of their references, they are from years ago, the most recent only being 2015. Since then, we still haven't learned our lesson, with National Geographic saying the cover is only at 6%. While still better than the prior number, it just proves how little caring was actually done, even with the record lows. In the 5 years since we have done virtually nothing to help the horrors we have already caused, and my guess is that without real push for change and a major influence shift, we will continue to do what we are so used to- nothing.

After reading the solutions Project Drawdown summarized, I was amazed to see that refrigerators were at the top of the list contributing to climate change. I had no idea that the very thing we depend on to keep our food cool and to store was such a big contributor to the emissions put out into our atmosphere. Although it was causing a bigger problem to our ozone layer in the 1900s and was fixed in the 80s, the problem was still technically not fixed since it is releasing great amounts of CO2 into our atmosphere.
                 <br><br>

The website really focused on giving us information about how we can fix things that are causing a great deal of destruction to our environment. I don’t think it is necessarily a shock to find out how much food we are wasting and dumping out because it doesn’t look “pretty” or “perfect” enough for stores and consumers. I always knew that Americans in general were very wasteful people just by going to restaurants and seeing so many unfinished plates of food there were as well just being home and seeing my sisters dump half a plate of food into the trash because they were full.
                 <br><br>

One of the most saddening things I read about was educating women. I still find it hard to believe that countries do not allow women to become educated, that they are only seen as a person to bare children and nothing more. I thought it was crazy to see that if women and girls become educated, go to school, then they would wait longer to have kids later in life. Because of this, it is calculated that “It could result in 51.48 gigatons of emissions reduced by 2050.” That is insane! What if that actually happens? What if we all have smaller size families, limited to 1-2 children? Can you believe how much less CO2 will be produced and how much longer we can preserve our planet from being populated to its capacity?

I had the same shock with you when I see the refrigerator can cause such a big influence on climate change. In the past, I did notice that the refrigerator would need to work every minute or the food in it would decay, but what I worried at that time is do I need to pay a lot of electrical fee. I never imagined that refrigerators can produce pollution. And now, almost every house has a refrigerator, and some houses have more. These refrigerators can be a great number. If we are going to add the refrigerators in the store, the number would be astonishing, which I think is really bad for the current situation. About the food waste problem, I did notice that there are a lot of food waste in the United state, and there is no policy or some ways to solve this. In China, in order to prevent food waste, some restaurants made a regulation that if the customer wastes the food over a certain weight, they have to pay an extra fee for it. I think this is an effective way to prevent food waste and I think the US might take it. Also, I agree with your idea that people with higher education are less likely to bear children at an early age and bear less children. What I find luckily, a lot of young people now do not want to bear much children, or even do not bear children. So I believe, in the future, the population would reduce, and the pollution can be significantly reduced.

Living in the Coachella Valley, the presence of wind and solar energy alternatives are amongst the most prominent. It appears the adoption of both of these technologies have appeared to have had rapid followings, for example if you were to drive down I-10 past White Water, you'd be flooded with thousands of wind turbines. These also double as warning lights for planes flying at night into the local PS airport. Much of the concern I've heard in regard to the installation of wind turbines have been appearance. Painted in white, the wind turbines themselves have become iconic in the PS region, where visitors frequently pull off the road to experience and take pictures with the energy generators. The comment maid by the Solutions Summaries also mention how the surrounding land can be grazed and/or conserved with the addition of windmills. I feel that while the latter is true for the region in which I live, acceptance of wind energy has remained of relative interest to many, in regard to the environmental benefit it has. In particular once many come to terms with the addition to the landscape. The widespread use of solar energy is also present, with many people moving into new homes and converting to solar. While a great solution to individual and shared energy production, many in the region do not intend to do so unless the initial cost were to go down, and/or they were moving into a new residence. I have continued to find it interesting how solar energy will continue to develop in the region, in working to deal with the effects of climate change, and warming temperatures overall.

I am glad that we finally have been given an article that shows us solutions to the climate crisis rather than the effects that we have already done to the planet. Before reading this, I felt utterly hopeless: I felt that the future of the planet was ruined and would soon be filled with uninhabitable life. “ Project Drawdown” did not take a long time to read yet there was so much information of small steps humanity can take to stop climate change.

                 <br><br>

I didn't know that food waste is responsible for 8% of global emissions. Not only will creating a better system to help the climate, but it will also help low-income countries. Many low-income countries waste food because it goes bad and they don't have a way to save the food; creating “storage, processing, and transportation” will help economies and the climate. If humans start developing a plant-rich diet, it will not only benefit the environment; however, it will also be healthier to people because it lowers rates of chronic diseases. This diet can basically stop climate change if everyone participates. It is also essential to educate girls. Higher educated women have a tendency to have fewer kids that are healthier and obtain lower incidences of HIV/Aids. Since the world is already overpopulated this education would help lower the population because higher educated women would go to family planning. Women want more contraception and it will ultimately result in less of a carbon footprint.
                 <br><br>


This article shows ways in which we can help our climate but also how to help the economic problems in the world. Many of the solutions proposed are actually less costly than the original ways of land that take more of a carbon footprint. For example, geothermal use of energy to “earth heat” is free and is found on 10% of the earth. It taps into the underground reservoirs of steamy hot water and helps the global warming crisis and is cheaper. “Project Drawdown” was the correct approach for people who were starting to feel pessimistic about climate change.

I was also pleased to see that we were assigned a reading that did not just discuss all of the ways previous generations as well as our own generation, have ruined the planet. This reading left me optimistic about the future of the planet. “Project Drawdown” provides a comprehensive, detailed list of actions that we can take to combat climate change. These solutions targeted both ordinary people (plant-rich diet), corporations (solar farms) and governments (family planning). I appreciated how “Project Drawdown” was easy to read and supported its proposed solutions with various statistics, it even includes the sources at the bottom of each solution. 
                  <br><br>

Until reading “Project Drawdown”, I had no idea that the number one solution to mitigate climate change is refrigerant management. HFCs, which are commonly used in refrigerators and air conditioners, have 1,000 to 9,000 times the warming power of carbon dioxide. To combat this issue, at the 2016 Kigali conference, an accord was adopted to phase out HFCs. It is proposed that by implementing the proposed changes mentioned in the Kigali accord, we will be able to effectively reduce global warming by one 1 degree Fahrenheit! I also was surprised to learn that the number one thing an individual can do to combat climate change is to rethink how they approach food. Specifically, that they waste less food (solution number 3) and eat a plant-rich diet (solution number 3). In the United States, we waste one third to one half of all the food that is produced. However, at the same time, roughly 800 million people around the world do not have sufficient access to food. We need to rethink our food distribution system and make it so that less food is wasted and more food is able to reach those in need.

After reading about the what people can do about saving the environment, I actually can feel how people do this is to do small parts little by little. When I was reading about the top 25 ways that people can do to save the environment, I’m actually shocking about how big the data is and how huge the data is when combining 25 solutions together. People might probably not willing to do one of the 25 ways, since they feel it’s too much effort but too little progress, while they never realize how great they can proceed on human history. There are a lot of ways that I have never heard before, such as educating girls, silvopasture, temperate forests, peat lands, tropical staple trees, afforestation, tree intercropping, clean cookstoves, improved rice cultivation, while there are also a lot that are familiar to me, such as wind turbines, reduce food waste, plant-rich diets, tropical forests, family planning, solar farms, rooftop solar, regenerative agriculture. For me, I strongly agree with the part of educating girls and family planning, because it’s not only about protecting the environment but also about protecting human rights and knowledge, which is the base of reducing human demanding.

Reading these summaries of Project Drawdown truly brings a smile to my face as well as a sigh of relief. From all the previous lectures, we have learned so many climate change contributors that seems irreversible or impossible to fix in one generation. But reading about so many ways of fixing our environment soothes my tensed up and anxious mind. Also, I’ve learned many interesting new plans to fix climate change that I have never heard of before. The one I am most interested in is Nuclear power. As the YouTube recommended section often provides me with weird knowledge, I have learned that nuclear power is much more efficient and not as dangerous as people make it to be. As I am not an expert, I will stick to Project Drawdown’s plan of leaving Nuclear power as a last resort for energy production. 
                  <br><br>
Personally, I am not a numbers person, but reading the statistics of how each plan would decrease our carbon emission and slow down the rising global temperature really intrigues me. It is astonishing how there are so many ways to save our planet, but it is also saddening that these type of website does not get as much attention from the public.

I am also relieved after reading these feasible ways of reducing carbon emission and making a significant change in the climate crisis. Though the most intriguing ways would be educating girls, one that I would never think of if I haven't seen project drawdown. It is astoundingly interesting since educating women and empowering them could be so helpful in saving the planet. Well, it is fairly reasonable that high educational attainment is associated with low fertility and hence smaller family size, I never thought that such an issue could reduce a significant level of carbon emission by controlling the population. Plus, empowering and educating women could aid human development in general especially when family control might be a contributing factor to eliminate poverty. So I got the same feeling as Harry because these types of solutions are indeed simple but not really heard of, that this also a major thing to work on as to educate the public about these issues would be much more efficient to hold political camphanes on rejecting anthropogenic climate change.

When I first looked at the different solutions that were being presented by Project Drawdown, it reminded me a lot of the Sustainable Development Goals that were presented by the United Nations in order to make our Earth a better place. In essence, the Sustainable Development Goals, or the SDGs, are made to invoke international cooperation in order to solve the largest problems that our world face (and just an FYI, climate action is one of them). Yet, because I thought about the SDGs, it made me think a lot about how much international consensus and cooperation it takes in order to fulfill these goals. When I look at the goals that are presented by Drawdown, I perceive it in the same light: in order for these solutions to be possible, everyone must be invested. 

                  <br><br>

Solutions - which include food waste or wind turbines - are great to implement in communities, but to feel the full weight, we need to implement these solutions at a global scale. That is quite the task, and this problem is explainable through the tragedy of the commons. The tragedy of the commons essentially states that one person’s use of a nonrenewable resource won’t place a great effect on our planet. However, if everyone carries that mindset, then the problem will grow, causing the effects to greaten significantly. This mindset applies greatly to the climate change crisis. We all believe that our contributions to climate change are not very significant because we believe that we are just one person; that everyone else is doing the work for us, so there is no need for us to make any significant changes. They are, however, wrong.

                  <br><br>

This mindset is applicable on both the individual and international level. Countries that are helping to combat climate change and are intently implementing these solutions are seen as the nations that “doing the heavy lifting.” However, when we look at the other nations that are not doing anything or doing very little, it is because they believe that there is no work to do; that their impact is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. But, that is just not the way to look at our world problems today. 

                  <br><br>

SDG goal number 17 is for international cooperation for the rest of the goals. And, the idea of cooperation needs to come up more often. In order to achieve our goals, we have to be under consensus that these are goals. We must avoid the mindset that our impact means nothing, because, in reality, it is everything.

I agree with you, these proposals are great but in order for these solutions to be possible, everyone must be invested. It’s true that if only one person transitions to a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, it will not affect the planet at all. But if we all collectively carry the same mindset, then we can expect to work towards a better planet. Sometimes I think why should I take steps to lower my carbon emissions when my impact is so small, I’m sure everyone thinks the same and that’s why we are failing to combat the climate crisis. 
                  <br><br>

We are sitting around, assuming that maybe everyone else is doing their part so we don’t have to do ours. I agree with you that we all believe that our contributions to climate change are not very significant because we are just one person, so there is no need for us to make any significant changes. We need to realize that we are all part of the problem whether we like it or not. You’re part of the problem unless you live on some remote island and have never touched a piece of technology. In order to make real change, we all need to realize that we each have our own impact, and we are able to combat the climate crisis.


<br><hr>
To reduce climate change, everyone needs to be invested, no doubt. The solutions offered by Project Drawdown work best only if they are approached with cooperation on the national and individual level. Also, I think your reference to “tragedy of the commons” is really accurate because it applies to the way climate change is a consequence of everyone’s emissions combined. If everyone believes that their carbon emissions don’t significantly impact the environment, no one is going to make any lifestyle changes to reduce climate change.

I definitely agree; fighting the climate crisis should be both on a global and individual level. When I first saw this reading assignment, I thought that it would be one of those typical readings that name a few solutions that don't really apply to us; after reading about the solutions, I realized I was completely wrong. I loved how this reading assignment suggested solutions both on a personal and international level.
                  <br><br>
On an international level, I completely agree with you that everyone must be invested. In large scale methods such as wind turbines, rooftop solar panels, and switching to geothermal energy, countries need to come together and collaborate on these methods. The website states how some countries are already taking drastic measures to be more sustainable; Germany already installed 1.5 million solar panels, while Bangladesh boasts more than 3.6 million home solar systems. In order to switch to geothermal, countries also need to communicate and work with one another. I found it shocking that 39 countries can supply 100% of their electricity needs from geothermal energy, but only 6-7% of the world's geothermal power has been tapped; this means that door to potentially switching to geothermal is very much open, but countries need to find a way to go through the door together.
                  <br><br>
I agree with your point that it is wrong for people to think that their changes will be insignificant because other large-scale bodies (such as countries) are doing the work for us. The website suggested personal methods of fighting the crisis, such as switching to a plant-based diet and reducing food waste. Regarding plant-based diets, emissions would be reduced by as much as 70% through a vegan diet and 63% through a vegetarian diet. Finding ways to reduce our habits and tendencies to waste food can also contribute to fighting the crisis as well.
                  <br><br>
Overall, this reading gave me a new perspective on the crisis. Not only can we do this together on a grand scale, but we can also do it individually as well.

Ryan, I couldn’t agree more with your comment on the Project Drawdown reading. I think that some of the top 25 ideas are great and I couldn’t really argue against any of them very well. However, even though these ideas are great, the most important thing we have to do globally is to first accept the idea of climate change. The next thing is just as important after that; we as a people need to buy into the idea that the things we do have consequences that negatively impact the world everyday. Much like what you said, if everyone is enveloped in the mindset that one person doesn’t make a difference if they use renewable energy or pollute the planet or whatever it may be, then it leads to the problem that we are trying to solve in the first place. It's true, maybe one person out of 7.5 billion doesn’t make too much of a difference. But, if everyone were to think this way, then all of a sudden it isn’t one person out of 7.5 billion, it’s now the majority of the 7.5 billion people that believe that what they do doesn’t matter. It’s in fact exactly the opposite. The most important thing to note is that there needs to be a change in the thinking of people all around the world. Yes it’s most important that this mindset change needs to happen within the United States, Russia, and the E.U. since we make up ⅓ of the CO2 emissions of the world, but like you stated Ryan, it is a global issue that we all need to come together to tackle. This being said, I’m glad Project Dawn has given us some hope in listing out some of the best ideas to help reduce pollution and reduce the climate crisis.

Going through this list for solutions to reducing climate change in the project drawdown article was quite interesting as they all seemed very reasonable and possible. There were a lot of self-explanatory and logical solutions such as eating a plant-based diet to not promote the meat industry and thus reduce greenhouse gases as well as the solution of making more wind turbines to utilize natural energy. Refrigerant management was a bit surprising to me though, as I feel like by now with all of the technology we have in the world we should have figured out a solution to creating artificial cooling in an environmentally conscious manner that doesn't hurt the environment. This being said I am no scientist or understand what it takes to create an artificial cooling mechanism so it may be much more complex than I am making it out to be, however, I am encouraging for our modern-day technologies to be focused on replacing past inventions and everyday items with ones that are more environmentally friendly or even produced in a more environmentally-friendly fashion.


                  <br><br>


Another interesting solution was encouraging further education for women. While this seems like a social issue that should not even exist, it reflects on our environment and climate change. As there are trends in which women who have higher learning education tend to have healthier and fewer children, both of which take fewer resources to adequately provide for making a step towards minimalism. Higher educated women also move up into the world with higher-paying jobs and provide to both their families and the economy. Thus by simply supporting the idea of equality in that women should have equal access to education, the economy can grow, as well as environmentally we would take a much smaller impact in green house gases, taking steps forward to having a healthy earth.

I was surprised to read that the number one solution to reduce the amount of gases emitted and refrigerant management since I had not even heard of that being an issue. The main issue that the news platforms talk about contributing to the climate crisis is polution from factories, cars or plastics. I did not imagine that the chemicals in the air conditioner and refrigerators would be a number one factor for greenhouse emissions. This kind of information I think is very important since I don’t think people are aware of this and often only think of the factors talked about on the news. I constantly use the air conditioner carelessly  even at times it is not really needed, but because of habit. Knowing how much gas emissions air conditioners and refrigerator produce has made me more aware and conscious when I do decide to use the air conditioned and limit the usage. 
                  <br><br>
I agree with Ken that the top 25 solutions seem to be a lot more effective than the rest of them. I was surprised to see that cars, airplanes and mass transit was so low in the list given how much we have discussed that they produce a quarter of our carbon footprint. When I saw food waste reduction being the third most important solution in reducing gas emissions  that made sense to me since I do see whenever I go out to eat or even at the dining commons how much food is wasted daily. Not to mention the whole process food goes through before it reaches the supermarket.  It is concerning to know as Ken mentioned that a third to half of the food produced is wasted, not just because of the climate issues,but because there is still a lot of world hunger occurring every day. It is sad to know so much food is wasted and yet so many go without enough food.  I think if we were more conscious of how much food we buy and not get more than what we can actually eat it would greatly help the planet, and if people have too much food that could possibly be donated, that they should. I think the U.S. does have a lot of food insecurity issues that need to be addressed.

After completing the Project Drawdown reading I felt like I had just completed the most simple, yet most effective reading of this entire class. Many readings in this class were also effective on me, but to me the message found in these 25 categories was extremely eye opening. It was interesting to be able read about some of the top ways that we can turn around our planet and put it back on a much healthier path. I found it inspiring to see that I knew a fair amount of topics on the list considering that I really began focusing on the climate crisis maybe about a year ago. It was also inspiring to me that I did not know some of them like refrigerant management, or peatlands. I found it inspiring personally because of how it triggered me in a motivational way to continue to read without being bored and hesitant to continue. I am sure the simplicity of the read had to do with it, but certainly the reading of very useful knowledge to help combat a very critical issue in today’s society helped a lot. This to me was also the most important reading because of how feasible these things seem to be. It is a perfect outline of how we can reduce carbon emissions by an incredible amount of gigatons each. For example just by reducing food waste and switching to a plant-rich diet a combined total of 136.64 gigatons of carbon emissions can be reduced. I mention two food topics as I found one statistic rather interesting and in a way sad. It was said that if all cattle were to form their own nation by themselves it would be the world’s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases. This was incredibly shocking to read as it almost seems unreal to me. Things like this have been put upon us from big companies and government officials that do not care for the consequences, yet the ones who do barely have a voice. At times it feels rather pointless to continue to fight this issue, but it is readings like this that make the end goal seem a lot closer. Obviously it would be rather impossible to immediately take action on all 25 topics, but just one at a time is major progress. Some of these topics are so effortless to accomplish and honestly should be practiced regardless of the carbon emission issue. Things like educating girls, family planning, and managed grazing are some of the few topics that do not cost millions of dollars to accomplish. It is these like these that should become norms of society and not what we need to change to. 
                  <br><br>


As I have previously stated, this reading was very simple yet the most important so far this quarter. The summaries were well written and the carbon emissions reduction numbers were right there along with everything else. This reading was not depressing in any way, but instead inspirational and motivational to me. I truly hope we get the opportunity to read more articles like this one.

I completely agree with your opinion on the reading. It was a very succinct yet detailed description of potential emissions reductions strategies. I even read it in its entirety, unlike the other readings (sorry Ken). Certain topics were also knew to me, such as afforestation and tree intercropping. I will probably end up recommending this reading to anyone who wants to learn more about the climate crisis. The most interesting topic to me was rice farming, as I did not realize how much methane it releases into the air. I wonder if there is any organization or government that is reaching out to rice farmers and incentivizing them to improve/change their methods. This would benefit both the farmer and the environment, as their yields would likely increase while at the same time reducing their methane footprint. Overall great reading, 10/10 would read again.

The Summary of Solutions by Project Drawdown was very informative and put our nation’s energy use into perspective for me because sometimes just hearing numbers don’t conceptualize the big picture. I was surprised that number one on the list was Refrigerant Management because I had never even thought about refrigerators being environmentally taxing, but after reading on it, it makes total sense and actually made me very much appreciate all the amenities I have access to that are normalized in the 21st century. The “impact” section for wind turbines made me feel optimistic, yet pessimistic at the same time because I know that those against system change for a more sustainable nationwide lifestyle feel that it is just too costly. Here we can see that yes, it takes a lot of money ($1.23 trillion) to implement wind turbines, however, in the long term (three decades) we can save $7.4 trillion. This sounds great, but as we know it’s going to take a lot to make this shift and at the moment, I’m not confident that our government is going to take the steps to make the change. 
                  <br><br>


Third on the list, reducing food waste, really resonated with me because it’s something we can all easily do. I cringe every time I see my housemate or family member, or anyone for that matter, wasting food for no good reason. My aunt is one of those people who grocery shops with the best intention - that she will eat that broccoli or those strawberries - before it all goes bad, but in the back of her mind she knows that she won’t. I think something that can help this problem is simply buying less. You can always go back to the store if you need more and if you’re someone who constantly overbuys groceries, it’s obvious that you just don’t need that much at once. When most people throw out their food they don’t realize the immense impact on the Earth and I believe that bringing more awareness around this topic can change these wasteful habits. It saves everyone money and saves the planet, so why not try? Along with food-based change, another simple and profound change to make is switching to a plant-based diet. I think even simply reducing animal product consumption can do a lot environmentally. Although I’ve known about the effects of animal agriculture, I had no idea that a plant-rich diet would make it to number four on this list, but I’m really happy about it because I used to become discouraged feeling that I wasn’t contributing enough to better the climate crisis, but being vegan is something that I’m really proud of for many reasons and I’m glad it’s becoming more and more normalized and accessible, especially in California.

After reading the most effective ways to cut down emissions, I realized that sometimes what we think could possibly due us best, might be not be what is truly best. I was truly surprised when I learned that the most effective way to cut down CO2 Emissions was managing refrigerant. I would have probably thought that it would be driving or managing our meat consumption or something along the lines of the major things that have talked about In class or maybe even the fashion industry. It's actually quite interesting how some of the solutions are things that we have never really taken into account, for instance the Education of Girls and family planning. Of course, family planning within great metropolitan cities and very well developed countries like China and US, as well as Europe would make a major change, because we do put out 2/3 of the emissions out so population control would theoretically be extremely helpful. I wasn't too surprised when most of these solutions involved different ways of taking care of our environment like temperate forests, tropical forests, sylvopasture, and many more. 
                  <br><br>
This list that you gave us of the best solutions has kind of helped me realize that some of the solutions are some of the things we have least expected, but it has also helped me formulate ways that I can personally help or do on my part to help reduce emissions.

I Agree with your comment its always so supprising to find out all the different things one can do to be more eco-friendly especially the ones that arent as common but arethe most important. I find it interesting that we never talk about air and heating in buildings and cars. When I was trying to save gas over the summer I stopped using my air conditioner and it truely saved me so much gas it was crazy!

I'm excited that we are finally starting to delve deep into the solutions for the climate crisis in this class. What surprised me the most was refrigerant management being the number one solution in Project Drawdown for reducing our carbon footprints. I thought maybe reducing food waste or having a plant-based diet would be the top solutions, although them being solutions 3 and 4 are still pretty good, but I didn't expect it. No one talks about how bad refrigeration is for our environment, and I have never seen it discussed in media. I know fridges and air conditioners were pretty bad to some extent, but the fact that they use HFCs that have "1,000 to 9,000 times greater capacity to warm the atmosphere than carbon dioxide" shocked me. Almost every home uses a fridge. Air conditioning is used in so many homes and buildings. I do not know of any alternatives to fridges and air conditioning other than just flat out not using them. I wonder how exactly we will be able to phase out the use of HFCs because I know we won't be able to give up the convenience of refrigeration and AC.

I was also very surprised to learn that Project Drawdown characterized "Refrigerant Management" as the number one solution. I think that because humanity views the patching of the ozone layer as a success, due to the Montreal Protocol, that people think the issue is totally solved. I consider myself a pretty environmentally engaged person and I was not aware that this was such a pressing issue because of this. I wish that this was something that the media and governments talked about because I feel like a lot of people would be more mindful and more supportive of phasing out HCFCs and for " effective disposal of...[fridges]...currently in circulation".
                   <br><br>

Aside from the refrigerators though, I thought that Project Drawdown served as a great tool for guidance on how to reduce CO2 emissions and ultimately create a more efficient, greener world. I think that having road maps like these, can do governments a great service as they highlight the most important areas for legislation to be put into action. This of course means that the government and public need to have the environment as a top priority. While this is not the case right now in the US, I hope that Project Drawdown can serve a useful tool in, hopefully, the near future.


<br><hr>

I also found it quite interesting that the number one solution to helping climate change efforts was refrigerant management. I would have figured it would have been something I was more familiar with, rather than this idea that I hadn’t even heard of. I did find this reading refreshing, especially after being exposed to such disheartening content throughout the quarter.  It was neat to see so many viable and logical solutions to such giant issues all written out in one piece. This gives me much hope that the planet can have a bright future if actions like these are taken. It makes me wonder, if we have such well-thought-out solutions, why haven’t we made these changes? 
                  <br><br>

I also noticed that a decent amount of the solutions pertained to food, which seems like a very consumer-based fix. This means we, the people, have a direct ability to make changes in our lives (what we buy, where we buy it) that will help the entire planet. Other ideas mentioned may be on the trickier side to actually get done, as they require billions of dollars, as well as permits, construction, resources, etc. Food is likely one of the most personal, individual, and simple ways to help end the crisis.

Hi, Kim. I thought you have just brought a great point for it. After reading this "Project Drawdown", I felt the same with you, because we are currently taking actions on environmental problems. More and more people start to care about our earth, I guess most of them are trying to leave a good environment for their heirs. What you have said that the number one solution in Project Drawdown is to reduce our carbon footprints, that's what I totally agree with. The refrigeration causes much more damage to the environment than the carbon dioxide. And we can't imagine how many people are using refrigerators around the world. the pollution is causing the ice to melt. The scientist group found out that as the ice melts, it may release some virus that has never been found in our world. Some might be a disaster for us. We can't just keep doing what we are doing right now, because it would cause the extinction of human beings. From now, we must reduce the pollution we are releasing to the natural world. For example, we can invent some cars that release less carbon dioxide, refrigerators that release less carbon footprint.

After reading "Project Drawdown," I learned that there are many ways, which people can utilize to save our planet. Because of so many gas emissions that exist in the environment, scientists are coming up with many different kinds of solutions and outcomes that people can contribute to in a very positive way. One of the most interesting information that I learned from this reading is that unplanned pregnancies have a huge impact on the environment. It reminds the audience about how significantly impactful unplanned pregnancies could be to our planet. However, one part I do not like to agree on is that the reading emphasizes that WOMEN specifically has to be careful and take responsibilities for have those pregnancies. Although I do agree that is plausible, I wish the reading focused on how men should take responsibility even more because it is also the men's actions that contribute to unplanned pregnancies. Therefore, it is great to know that we are finding out solutions that can effectively guide the readers and other people to help save our planet. However, I hope we can realize that it is EVERYONE'S responsibility.

I agree with you, especially about the part about unexpected pregnancies. I do agree with this reading in many ways, like the almost-in-half food production and how transportation and housing harm the environment a lot. But the part about unexpected pregnancies, I don't think it’s women who should be especially careful. This is a two-people’s job. And in this case, it’s women who often suffer from abortion or giving birth of a child. I think it’s more than a women or men problem. I think the whole society has a responsibility in it. First of all, the government needs to make more specific policies in the pregnancy issues. Second, the public should be aware of the dangers of unexpected pregnancies to the environment, and other things on the list.

Like many of my peers, I was shocked by the list provided by this week's reading. At first I was like, "refrigerant management??" and then I really thought about it and a wave of enlightenment came over me. This may sound dumb but, I honestly forget that refrigerators are on 24/7. I realized that going to the fridge, taking food out, putting food in, are such mindless activities that I don't contemplate how much electricity is involved in keeping these fridges on! On topic of food, food waste was something I expected to be on this list. 
                  <br><br>

Although I grew up in a household where food waste was looked down upon, my experiences in college have amplified my yearn to control food waste. Especially when it comes to buying food and eating it. Every time I grocery shop I'm way more invested in being mindful with what I buy. I buy food that I know I will eat and amounts I know I can consume. However, I know there are many who didn't grow up with the same values I did, or can not/did not receive the education I am receiving. Which is why I think it's important for grocery markets to start stressing the importance of not wasting food. Let me put it this way: similar to a restaurant that charges for left over food, imagine if we had to pay every time we wasted food. I think it would revolutionize way people approach food by forcing them to really understand the value of food and food waste. Nonetheless, such an example is unfortunately impossible to actually carry out. We must put our best efforts into making people more aware of what they're tossing and what they're buying at the places where food is available for purchase and consumption.
                  <br><br>

Transitioning to the topic of the education of women and family planning... I think that it's a great proposal and I love that it was included on the list. However, I feel that it should also include sexual education for all regardless of gender because there are many unfortunate situations where the woman isn't always in control. I think that the consequences of unplanned parenthood, importance of preventative care and overall sex ed knowledge should be spread among the entire population regardless of gender for maximum effect.

It is very interesting to learn about the solutions provided by Project Drawdown. Among the top 25 solutions, there are some that I haven’t heard of. Even for the few ones that I know of, I didn’t realize how impactful they would be before I read the articles. For instance, I knew that educating girls and family planning would be able to reduce emissions by controlling our world population that has been growing exponentially. However, I didn’t really understand how big of an impactful can they make on family size and world population, because people rarely approach this issue from the environmental side. 
                  <br><br>


It is also interesting to see how many of the top solutions belong to the electricity generation sector. Many people like to say that adapting to renewable energy is troublesome and expensive, but the solutions listed show a lot of possibilities with what we can do. There are many sources of energy that could be utilized more. Also, as we improve on more advanced technologies, it would be easier, cheaper, and more productive for use to generate electricity.

I am glad that the author mentioned the importance of educating females across the world on contraceptives. I also think it is very important for all males to hold themselves accountable on their side of the deal if we are to make serious changes globally. I agree with you, I hadn't heard of a few of the solutions, but what took me even more by surprise was the fact that the last twenty-two most important solutions combined would not surpass the top three in terms of reducing our carbon footprints. If we are to take the crisis seriously before it is too late, we need to get our families, communities, and cities on board before we can start a worldwide movement. Some places around the world are already taking the steps to better themselves and the Earth. Just as Ken had mentioned in a previous video, the countries that are doing this are far less wealthy than the United States. The United States as a country is completely capable of turning the tide in the time of this crisis. Although some of the solutions are more important than the others, it is obviously still important to practice the ones at the bottom of the list because everything is accounted for when it comes to releasing greenhouse gases.
                  <br><br>

Coming into this class, I knew a little bit about CFCs  and how detrimental they are to the environment as I took a global warming class over summer. What I did not know was the extent of how bad they are. I think many other people have this problem in not knowing certain things are damaging our environment and releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. If we informed people in an effective way, I am confident that we are going to be able to reverse the effects of the warming that has already happened. Things like switching to a plant-based diet are not too hard as hundreds and thousands of people decide to make the transition daily. I for one had made the switch over summer but have stopped because of the food provided at the dining commons. The amount of meatless food provided to us students is not enough to fill my appetite throughout the day. We as students must address the situation to the board and see if we can make a change in the dining commons to better our planet. Once the little changes in our diet,  and around the house occur, I  believe the rest of the solutions will only feel natural to take part in.

I enjoyed how positive the reading was for this week. The solutions provided all seem to be very possible. This reading is an effective approach to climate change as it gives people easier and more viable options without necessarily pointing fingers at a specific group. The top 3 ways to lower CO2 emissions are surprising nonetheless. 
                  <br><br>
Refrigerant is not a topic that pops up in many peoples' minds, yet it is such a global problem. With today's technology, the issue can be resolved with relative ease compared to the other solutions. It is now just up to people to put changes in effect. Windmills provide a surprising amount of reliable power. If the industry were to be seen as profitable, I am sure that technological advances would make it so that turbines become a viable source of energy. Lastly, changing to a more sustainable food source is also a logical and simple step, yet will probably be the one that receives the most push back. Many people, including I, would find it hard to give up our eating habits. The fact that most of these steps cannot be carried out to 100% their full potential highlights the importance of doing as much as you can. Ensuring a gradual transition to a more sustainable lifestyle will prove to be more effective as opposed to radical change.

I also agree. I appreciated the simplicity of this text, a it was one that went straight to the facts. It inspired me with optimism and hope for our planet, which is a quality that many other sources failed to provide. The whole notion or refrigerant management came as a surprise as a leader in the solutions to combat climate change.

I had previously heard through word-of-mouth about the dangers of refrigerant emissions and remember that at the time I had been very skeptical of the validity of the information being told to me, and I imagine most people would be. It's definitely not what my first guess would be for the top possible reduction in CO2 emissions, and is never mentioned in common discourse about the climate crisis. So it was incredibly interesting to learn about the numbers and scale of the problem, as well as what we are doing internationally in order to draw back these emissions (per the Kigali Accord). I was also surprised to learn that the top 3 issues contribute more emissions than the rest combined. I can't wrap my head around how this knowledge can be available and yet we are not doing absolutely everything possible to solve even just the three worst carbon-emitters. 
                  <br><br>

This reading also helped me realize how much carbon emissions result from a misuse of land, and our relationship to it. 11 of the 25 things listed had to do with land, agriculture or food production. This really reinforces the idea that humans, and our abuse and overpopulation of land, is the principal cause of all environmental issues. Not only do we have to switch to plant-based diets, but we also have to pressure our governments and farmers to practice better techniques of farming and land conservation in order to reduce carbon emissions.

I completely understand your reaction/feelings when you realize that we have all this knowledge, but no actual action towards resolving the issues is being done. I don't completely understand your statement regarding the top 3 issues contributing more emissions than the rest because the math doesn't add up, but we digress. 

                  <br><br>

A point that you mentioned that resonates with me is that we need to pressure our government in helping solve this crisis. They are ultimately the people who can make significant change on a greater societal level. This is why we need to vote in the upcoming national election for people who have this change in mind. The current presidency is only worsening the situation (e.g. creating jobs such as coal mining). Along with national elections, we also need to vote in local elections. People tend to forget about these, when these elections are also equally important.

The selection of reading this week was very unique--I found it refreshing to fully deep dive into different solutions that can be used to addressing climate change in the context of infrastructure. I also enjoyed how the different methods were divided into a short summary, and then an impact, as it fully puts the solution into a useful context. A good thing about many of the solutions is that it doesn't just completely dissolve a problematic aspect of life in 2020, such as flying, but rather aims to reduce carbon emission as much as possible and make them as efficient as possible. This will definitely help in appealing to people who are comfortable with contributing poorly to the environment; they can still choose to harm the planet, but at least do so in a less harmful way.

                  <br><br>

In my opinion, one of the more interesting solutions is the implementation of safeguards for wetlands, as well as restoring them. I didn't know that a lot of carbon was found within their compositions, and I think doing things to help them is definitely a less problematic (when I say problematic I mean easy to adjust to) method than other things, such as, carpooling. I also approve of the solutions that revolve around designing buildings, such as retrofitting, energy storage, and using dynamic glass. It's definitely eye-opening to see how so many little things, whether it be in buildings, or transportation, contribute negatively to the climate through carbon emissions.

Yeah, I think so too. The solutions the reading gave this week is really different from what I used to know. There are always saying that we should reduce the car emission, and use public transportation, but I haven’t never heard about regulate the global temperature through the industrial or  farming aspect. It’s the first time I see the solutions like restoring the abandoned farmland, alternative cements. It’s surprising that there are such a huge amount of farmlands have been abandoned as people all would choose a Less causative way to just find a new farmland. As people restore those farmland by planting trees, there will be more greens helping with reducing CO2

Hey Justin! I agree with your comment, I find it to be very refreshing how instead of focusing on all the things that we are doing wrong, this reading was more focused on all the things we can do to help our planet and reduce carbon emissions. While you mentioned that its very surprising that some of the little things contribute so much to carbon emissions, something I found interesting is that if you unplug your phone for a whole day, you are saving energy but then use that same amount of energy in one second of driving a car, crazy! This reading made me think of the new wind field they are putting up in Lompoc that just got passed! Very exciting to see the little things happening that will soon have a larger impact on our planet and reducing our carbon emissions.

I have learned a lot from these 25 energy-saving and emission reduction methods, and also have some new findings. At first, many of the efficient methods that I thought didn't appear in my vision, but many that I thought would not be very effective seemed more effective. For example, the professor mentioned that you can easily unplug the mobile phone charger when it is not charging. Although the energy consumption in one day is almost the same as that in one second of driving, what really shocked me was that the mobile phone charger is also consuming electricity when it is not charging. I didn't know about it or believed it was true before. In the past 25 energy-saving methods, I was shocked to find that reducing food waste and improving women's education level are also so effective. I never thought that improving women's education level would have such an effect on the economic system and society. Moreover, reducing food waste is far more energy-saving than most people think of replacing LED light bulbs with energy-saving models Emission reduction. I believe many people don't know these points, so these methods should be known by more people.

Everything you have mentioned that surprised you from this week’s reading has shocked me as well. It blew my mind to hear that all the energy saved in one day when switching off your phone charger is used in one second when you drive a car. 1 second!! That is astounding to me. Moreover, I am very thankful that Ken gave this reading. I was very unaware about certain energy-saving methods including educating girls, refrigerator management, and silvopasture. In addition, I was also not aware of how this simple blueprint to solving climate change will have such an intense impact on helping our environment and save money as well. For every solution listed in Project Drawdown, under the “Impact” side it would say that accepting these solutions in our world would reduce carbon by so-and-so “gigatons” and reduce emissions by approximentally 50%. People are always thinking about saving energy via light, when really there are so many other things we could be doing that are beneficial. Eating chicken instead of meat, making more high-quality plant based meat substitutions so that those who have a higher-income will want to purchase the substitution versus the meat. So many systems of our farming can be changed as well and this will benefit farmers all over the world because these systems will give them the opportunity to grow crops at any time of the year, and not dry out the soil.

This week's reading was by far the most enjoyable of all of the readings we have done. I appreciated its concise and clear list format as it allowed me to focus more on solutions as individuals rather than as a collective. Project Drawdown helped me see the real-world factors that go behind the thought process of how exactly the climate crisis can be reduced and ultimately negated. Another thing that caught my attention was how they used economic factors to show how most changes to repair the climate would be a financial positive by 2050, something that has always halted the movement to stop climate change as it is often depicted as extremely expensive and not likely due to its financial burden. This article also brought to my focus exactly how many possibilities we have to help stop climate change. While there are the obvious propositions like reducing food waste and limiting population, I found it interesting and surprising that refrigerant management was the number one solution to helping fight climate change. As most people in the United States and fellow first world countries know, air-conditioning is a blessing. Growing up in Bakersfield California, temperatures routinely rise over a hundred degrees Fahrenheit and sometimes even come close to one hundred and twenty degrees. Naturally, I love air conditioning and I've also understood that is a big drain as an energy source but I would never have estimated that it was such a bad heat pollutant. Overall, I liked this article specifically because of how it is presented and the concise and fundamentally sound information it states.

Just like you, I am quite shocked by the fact that HFC is the first major problem in global warming clear list. However, as a former econ major student, I have doubt about your words that '"how how most changes to repair the climate would be a financial positive by 2050, something that has always halted the movement to stop climate change as it is often depicted as extremely expensive and not likely due to its financial burden." We refer to economic benefits as short-term and long-term. Apparently, climate protection is an increasingly profitable thing to do considering the exacerbation of climate now and there is hardly doubt about it. The reason why people resist to protect the environment with the reason "extremely expensive and not likely due to its financial burden" is because in the short term, these approaches can strike economy quite heavily. Let us take the example of building off-shore windmills. Have you ever thought about why such approaches were carried out by a toy corporation LEGO but not government or at least some organizations that supported by the public? That's because they are simply too expensive. Although they can provide all electricity in Liverpool, the input of building these giant stuff and the efforts to put tons of iron in the sea require tremendous amount of money, which is regarded uneconomic for local government and cannot draw support from the public. I mean people are short-sighted and to persuade those stubborn guys,(if they are not, why don't they advocated climate change in the first place) I am not sure that these highly demanded infrastructure constructions will be appealing. Therefore, I am quite surprised and also quite disappointed that such unrealistic approaches will be ever listed on the top 25. If unrealistic approaches can be listed, why not list "find a new Earth that allow us to restart the game" lmao.

I found that this list created by Project Drawdown is very useful to see how things as simple as reducing our food waste or educating girls could decrease our overall carbon footprint by over one hundred gigatons of atmospheric carbon emissions. It was very nice to see that we could easily cut back our carbon emissions to the point where the effects of climate change would be drastically lessened. However, most of the solutions in the top twenty-five of this list could only be achieved if we changed the systems that we currently have in place. Change as big as these are not as easy to accomplish especially since we are having to maneuver through the companies who do not want us to change our ways to get to the change we want and need. The changes that we can do in our own personal lives were said by Ken to only be around one-tenth of the change that we could get out of something as big as reducing our food waste. This drastic difference can be very disheartening and cause people to feel as though all of their hard work is for nothing when it is being blown by just by someone driving their diesel car to work. Yes, this road map to show us how to reduce our carbon footprint is great but trying to find how to get to the start of this road map is our biggest struggle. The heads of these oil companies, seed companies, and power companies do not want us to be switching to solar or reducing our meat intake because it hurts their own income and that is more important to them then if their ways are hurting the planet we are all living on. It would be amazing to see us get even the first twenty-five solutions on this list because if we were to do that, we could be reducing our emission by over eight hundred gigatons which would equal to trillions of people’s yearly amount of CO2 they should be released into the atmosphere. If only it could be much easier to implement these solutions into our lives.

I think reading Project Drawdown deemed to be very insightful and overall very enlightening. To begin with, what really grabbed my eye was the rooftop solar panel subsection. Growing up I always heard about solar panels being the future and how they were going to become widespread throughout the globe. However, the older I got the less I started hearing about solar panels and then in grade 10 we had a geography project centered around solar panels. Through this, I learned that similar to electric cars, the production process of solar panels itself emits a grave amount of carbon emissions.  More specifically, I clearly remember that back when I was doing research for this project, the number of carbon emissions from the production process can be likened to the same amount of emissions from 20 flights of the route Brussels-Lisbon. However, since then I have read in several different places that there has a been large decrease in the number of carbon emissions from producing and installing solar panels. However, one problem which still hasn't been addressed is the disposal of solar panels at the end of their life cycle. Solar panels often contain lead, cadmium, and other toxic chemicals that cannot be removed. Furthermore, due to this, the whole solar panel is considered hazardous by many including the state of California. Thus, as Project Drawdown mentions, the PV solar panel industry is growing at a much faster rate which means there'll also be an increase in the disposal of solar panels. My question is, do the benefits of solar panels outweigh the detriments?

I had a very similar reaction, especially to refrigerant management. I studied CFCs and HCFs in my high school environmental science class, but from what I've learned, I think this is the main problem after Kyoto. I didn't realize that there was still a big problem with refrigerants, which shows how small the climate crisis is, and it's a big problem. Few people really know what will have the biggest impact on climate change, and there is too much ambiguity and misdirection about how to tackle the problem and allocate resources properly. That's what I love about reading this week -- it really breaks down problems into nice Numbers and shows how different actions can help solve them. There are a lot of things that can be done, both personally and globally, that can have a huge impact on the environment, and this reading has really turned it into a perspective, which I love.

I enjoyed reading Project Drawdown, because compared with other readings we were assigned, this reading is more optimistic toward the climate change issue. But I’m really shocked when it mentions that our refrigerators and air conditioners are the main source of global warming as well. We use our refrigerators every day, and few of us ever realize that they trigger climate change. However, it is really good to know that the main way to reduce CO2 is to change the materials we use in our refrigerators. I like reading all the solutions in the reading because it makes me feel the hope and I would like to see things changing.

Project Drawdown is one of the most comprehensive, detailed, and easy to follow plans for actions governments, businesses, and individuals can take to mitigate the climate crisis that I've seen to date. What stood out to me most is the sheer organization of the website and the provided information on each topic needing to be addressed. The prioritization list itself really narrows down the issues we as a society currently have and what new technologies or lifestyle changes we should be focusing on implementing. The way the Summary of Solutions was organized introduced me to issues I hadn’t even considered being leading contributors of methane or carbon dioxide emissions previously such as refrigerant management (#1) or clean cookstoves (#21). I was surprised to see that improving or expanding modes of transportation were listed towards the end of the list with trains listed as #74, ridesharing #75, electric bikes #69, and cars #49, just to name a few. Given the past few lectures given in class, I would’ve expected every aspect of transportation included to be within the top 10-25. 

                  <br><br>

One of the greatest arguments of deniers of the climate crisis is that change is unaffordable. Seeing the billions of dollars that could be potentially saved from investing in projects such as solar farms, wind turbines, or farmland restoration provides hope that large corporations, governments, or wealthy investors may turn to these options in years to come.

In the class so far, we’ve mainly talked about how CO2 is exponentially being emitted into the atmosphere. On the other hand, Project Drawdown gives solutions to decrease CO2 emissions. As I was reading, I was surprised to find out that refrigerant management, wind turbines, reduced food waste, were the top solutions. When I think of reducing emissions, I immediately think of transportation. After reading this week’s assigned reading, I noticed that transportation did not even make the top 25 list. Yes, there are many steps to mitigating the climate crisis; however, I believe we need to first focus on the issues that will affect the planet the most. 
                  <br><br>

Project Drawdown’s explanations to decreasing emissions are achievable. I wouldn’t be surprised if corporations knowingly ignored the issues described in Project Drawdown. The issue is, the public is not properly informed about these solutions. If the public was educated and spoke out, changes could be made. Prior to reading Project Drawdown, I had no idea that HFC’s existed or that they have 1,000 to 9,000 times greater capacity to warm the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. Why is no one talking about this? There should be rules created to ensure that all refrigerators and air conditioners only use natural refrigerants. Wind turbines have few drawbacks. It is competitive with and cheaper than coal generated electricity. Additionally, the switch to wind energy could potentially end dangerous coal mining conditions. I was unaware that food waste was produced so much CO2, but it makes sense. Every day I see plates of food wasted at the dining commons and it’s hard to think that so much energy was put into food that will eventually be thrown away. It’s sad to think about all the resources (seeds, water, labor, fertilizer, land) that are wasted. I think another cause of the amount of food wasted are the food portions in America. At restaurants, serving sizes are too large and the unfinished food is wasted. I think if less is consumed, less will produced, and as a result, less will be thrown away. We need to take action. Project Drawdown is a recipe to save Earth. Now, all we have to do is follow it.

Reply: Exactly! We usually focus on the solutions that we can make on a personal level, but the reading actually provided solutions at the global level. The reading made it very clear how beneficial renewables really are. Wind Turbines and PV solar panels are literally so cheap and far more efficient than coal or oil. I think if we do want to use advancements in technology to help the environment, we should look to improve the storage capacity of PV solar panels instead of creating making more Tesla products. Another possible solution is education and family planning. A huge issue we face is overpopulation and the main reason is that women in developing worlds don’t have enough access to contraceptives or enough education to actually pursue something more than just having a family.  If we can change the way we farm, we can make huge impacts on the world. There are so many ways we can slow down the Climate Crisis and most of them are either cheap or just implementing new techniques. I know that if we could broadcast this information and help people become more educated on the Climate Crisis, that more people would be willing to make the necessary changes. The main issue people have is that they don’t want to change their personal habits, and that’s understandable, but the reading showed that we can still make impactful changes by having our governments make these changes. I also couldn’t help but wonder if renewables and other environmentally friendly actions could be made into a profit, would major corporations and businesses be singing a different tune?

We really have been talking a lot about what emits CO2, and this week's reading focused more on how to decrease it. Like you I was also surprised about the refrigerator management, our fridge HFC is really 1,000-9,000 times greater at warming our atmosphere. I also didn’t know what HFC was but I do know that we should be informed, so then we can be able to choose AC’s that use natural refrigerants. I was surprised about the transportation as well, but I think that the top 25 were a combination of things we can do and also things that most affect our planet, so we need to really be aware. 



<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment. I had no idea that the items listed in this week's reading were some of the top ways to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Up until this point, we have focused on transportation and consumerism, and I noticed as well that neither of these topics made it into the top twenty-five. Like you, I believe a great deal of people think about transportation when it comes to the climate crisis. If this is not a top concern for saving the planet, then we should be focusing more on this list rather than something that is not; however, this is not to say that transportation will do nothing to aid in the reduction of carbon dioxide on out earth.


<br><hr>
Hey Jaime, just like you I was extremely surprised when transportation did not even make it onto the top 25 list of CO2 emissions. In hindsight, I probably should’ve expected it since Ken did note in an earlier video that flying barely even counts for 2% of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. Still, it was shocking! Just like you, I also thought it’s sad and just plain depressing how many resources are being wasted every day worldwide, second by second. You make a good point highlighting all the important resources that are being wasted: food, water, labor, even land itself. I’d like to point out the connection of all these resources being wasted to the problem of consumption that we touched upon. Thinking back to our discussions about the fast fashion industry, another huge resource being wasted is clothing! And considering how a vast majority of clothing items are made by cotton, which Ken has noted to require vast amounts of water to grow, it’s no wonder that the environment is suffering horribly, not having the capacity of resources to support the unhealthy lifestyles that hundreds of millions around the world live. 


<br><hr>
Yes! Most of the prior assignments were about the horrors that we were doing to the environment, so it made me happy and excited to read about possible proposed solutions. I, too, was shocked to see what the solutions were. Many of the things that I imagined being proposed were not proposed while the things that were proposed were things that many people have not heard of. This just shows how poorly society is informed about the current climate crisis. For example, when thinking about possible solutions for the climate crisis, not many people have refrigerant management in mind. However, that is the first thing on the solutions list. This shows how poorly the environment business is doing when it comes to informing the public. Years ago, changing our lightbulbs to more sustainable bulbs was on top of many household’s priorities, when that should not have been the case.




<br><hr>
I totally agree with what you said regarding food waste. Our culture is heavily based on consumption but on top of that Americans love their all you can eat restaurants and buffets. It always considered me how much food was wasted during these businesses operations. First, there is the food waste caused by us, the customers, as we often grab too much of what we can handle and toss it. Second, the waste the businesses create when they do not get rid of all their food in a given day. But then you pointed out a greater level to this that I did not realize until reading Project Drawdown. In order to operate these businesses, they use fridges, AC, and such to run. This adds to further emissions of greenhouse gasses on top if what you pointed out such as seeds, water, labor, etc. This new realization is so concerning to me as on the surface we are already doing bad as a country but on a deeper level we see how spread out these effects really are. We really need to change our ways and fix this along with the underlying issues in Project Drawdown as it points out that these "underlying" issues are major factors in emissions.

<p>
After reading Project Drawdown’s Summary of Solutions, I had learned a great deal more about the issue of climate change as a whole as well as the specific ways that the world can undertake in order to alleviate the climate crisis. There were many things in the list that I didn’t really expect to be on there, such as the reductions in and phasing out of the refrigerants including CFCs and HCFCs. I knew a little bit about those refrigerants from my middle school science class and their detrimental impacts on our atmosphere and causing ozone depletion, but I was pretty surprised to see it being at the number one most important task in climate change prevention. 

                  <br><br>

I agree with what Ken mentioned in the lecture video for this reading that refrigerant management is something that is rarely brought up in press and media if at all, so the majority of the public naturally overlooks the significant impacts of refrigerants on our environment. Instead, the media and the press are putting heavy emphasis on the small minor things such as switching to energy-efficient LED lights and unplugging phone chargers when not in use. Although these activities do assist in alleviating climate change and I don’t deny their legitimacy, they are ultimately too minor and small to actually have visible results and impacts on our environment, at least not in a reasonable amount of time. Just like the example Ken gave during the video, the energy saved from unplugging the phone charger for one day is used up in one second of car driving. This example shows that though those little activities are helpful and legitimate in mitigating the climate crisis, they are not solutions to climate change and people should not rely or depend upon doing these little things hoping climate change will disappear in several decades. What we should really focus on as a society, I think, is to encourage all citizens to do as many of these minor activities as possible in their daily lives while also addressing some of the more obvious bigger parts of the cause of climate change, such as refrigerant management and food production. 
                  <br><br>


Food production is the second-largest source of carbon emission in the world and people still waste ⅓ to ½ of the food produced, so it is not difficult to see why climate change does not get better but only worsened over the years because it is impossible to reduce the carbon emission from food production when consumers continue to waste food as usual. In this situation, the government should implement certain laws and policies to address the problem of food waste at a consumer level. This reminds me of the “clear-your-plate” campaign in China in 2013 when an NGO based in Beijing encouraged Chinese citizens to consume all the food they ordered, thereby reducing the amount of food they waste through the social media platform. I think this is something that can be initiated in the U.S. as well because the advancing social media platform allows people to connect with others more quickly and easily, and a similar movement that of “clear-your-plate” can quickly gain momentum on the internet with wide support from the citizens. From there, the rising popularity of this movement can soon attract the government’s attention and the government can pass laws and legislations to put such a voluntarily-sponsored event into actual laws regulating and restricting food waste at both a federal and a state level.

Like you, I had no idea that CFCs and HCFCs would rank as number one on the list, but it just further proves that what you see in the media is not necessarily true. It’s like some companies take an idea and run with it getting society to believe the wrong idea or to place more weight in a certain action than it deserves. As Ken said, unplugging our chargers won’t hurt, but I think the point is to be fully aware of all aspects of the climate crisis and how much effect each aspect contributes to.

I hadn’t heard of the “clean your plate” campaign until your comment, but I think it’s a totally good idea and making it a goal in society is really motivating. It reminds me of the video on mass transportation in Colombia we watched in class and how the mayor strived to make taking the bus “cool”. If we can make reducing waste “cool’ then we can motivate a lot of people to do it that wouldn’t otherwise have. While reading on food waste I found it totally annoying and superficial that so much produce never makes it to stores from farms because they’re imperfect, like a crooked carrot. Seriously? I get that farmers want their customers to be attracted to the produce, but it’s unnecessary and obviously doesn’t actually affect the taste or nutritional value of the food itself. This reminded me of a company I’ve heard of based out of San Francisco called Imperfect Foods. I love their work and basically what they do is deliver food orders to people that are “imperfect”. Maybe it’s not the prettiest potato or the straightest carrot, but it’s still completely edible so they make sure that those foods don’t go to waste.

I agree with Linjing’s statement about government involvement with food waste at the consumer level. The government’s political power, as well as the lobbying of governmental and environmental groups, can both be strong forces in climate change, but it just needs to be taken advantage of. With the right regulations in terms of food waste and the root of the source, production, the depletion of our climate can be an issue of the past. We must take action, not only ourselves with our individual decisions (especially in relation to diet and transportation), but with our electing power with officials. 
                  <br><br>
I enjoyed the diversity of solutions that were provided and was surprised that so many were food-related and land-related. One fact that was presented was that “The food we waste is responsible for roughly 8 percent of global emissions.” This fact was very shocking and disappointing because one root of global emissions comes from food production and everything involved with the production, including rainforest destruction and pesticide use as well as so many other factors. Without excessive food production, there would be fewer emissions already, and there would be less food waste as well. 
                  <br><br>
“As Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh has said, making the transition to a plant-based diet may be the most effective way an individual can stop climate change.” After reading more about the impact of switching to a plant-based diet (and watching “Cowspiracy”) I felt compelled to transition to veganism. I had attempted a vegan diet in the past at a young age when my mother decided it would be a healthy decision for our whole family but struggled to get an efficient amount of nutrients. Today, there are so many supplements and vegan options available, especially in Santa Barbara.

Project Rundown has been one of the most interesting reading assignments we have had for this class thus far. It provides us with actual solutions and changes that can be done in order to reduce the carbon emission and greenhouse gas emissions. The summaries that were giving with each solution really clarified what the problem was, what could be done to fix it, the reduction of CO2, and the overall cost of the solution. The top ranked solution is refrigerant management, which involves reducing the use HFCs in refrigerators and air conditioners and replacing them with natural refrigerants like propane and ammonium. 
                  <br><br>
Another solution that was discussed was the reduction of food waste in the world. Currently, we are producing enough food in the world to feed the entire world, the only issue is the redistribution of that food. There is an abundance of food being shipped to other countries and leaving actual countries that produce these foods without enough to sustain its own people. The film Wasted! also touched on this idea that supermarkets are hoarding food and throwing far too much food away when it is still perfectly good to be eaten. They discuss that best by dates on food are actually only indicators for when supermarkets hav to rotate produce and not actually when the produce goes bad. Additionally, people need to stop buying in bulk or excess amounts because they end up not actually eating the produce or actually letting it spoil. The consumer culture that people have been raised into also impacts the way that they shop for food, buying more than they will actually eat and throwing it away.

I also found this reading to be one of the most engaging. The information was very well organized and presented in a brief format that makes it much easier to hold a reader's attention. On top of that, it did not feel as commanding or argumentative as most climate articles do. It was a clear and concise presentation of facts. I could not imagine anyone being able to logically argue with this article.

After learning that the top 25 solutions of Project Drawdown can not only halt the climate crisis but lead to a reduction in emissions, I feel the most hopeful that I have felt over the length of this course so far. I think that a global plan of action is so much more reassuring than leaving the fate of our planet up to small individual decisions. While individual lifestyle changes are important, I do not believe that they can happen in a magnitude that is big enough and a timeline that is fast enough to make the necessary changes we need to save our planet in time. That is why it is so imperative that governments and large-scale institutions start implementing these plans, and why it is so frustrating that they have not already begun doing so. 
                  <br><br>


One of the few things from this reading that stood out to me the most was that refrigerant management was at the top of the list and can make such a huge difference. This is not an issue that is normally publicized and I am sure that I was not the only one who was unaware of the impacts of HFCs and how much of a difference the management and destruction of refrigerants could make to our planet. Another fact that stood out was how big of a change reduction of food wastes would made and how much of this waste is actually occurring at the consumer level. I live in a household where wasting food is unacceptable and it never occurred to me that this was not a value that high-income households has (and that the lack of this value was so harmful to our planet). I completely agree with the reading in that we need major interventions at the retail and consumer levels in regard to this issue.

Mohini, you made some excellent points in this comment. 

                  <br><br>

First off, I too believe that global plans of action are much more effective than smaller individual actions. For example, if only certain individuals were purchasing electric cars to help reduce carbon emissions while others used gas guzzling, inefficient cars, many of the efforts may cancel each other out. However, if instead everyone in a certain state or country was required to use an electric car, then the overall impact would be much greater. Climate change is a global issue - it requires the participation of every individual, not just individuals who decide to participate. 
                  <br><br>


I was also pretty surprised by how much of an impact the reduction of food waste would make on the environment. Reducing food waste definitely seems like one of the more doable individual actions that people can take. Simply buying food that you know you will use and need can make such a huge impact. Like your household, I think every household should adopt this mindset of wasting being unacceptable, whether it be low income or high income families. Beyond the individual level, I also think that retail/commercial companies need to have a similar ideology. Many companies - such as Olio, which helps to connect neighbors and local retailers so surplus food can be shared and not disposed of, have already started to help do this. As we move forward, hopefully more companies like these arise to help reduce the immense amount of food that is wasted every year.

I found the list of possible ways to reduce climate change very interesting. For the most part, they were all things that almost every individual can partake in and essentially reduce emissions on a global scale. They were all very straightforward and, for the most part, easy to do. It was a relief reading that almost 50% of paper gets recycled, and even up to 75% in some areas. Simple tasks as such are things everyone can do in order to help themselves, future generations, and essentially the world. In addition, I also enjoyed Ken addressing that housing, transportation, and diets are the most influential factors contributing to climate change on a personal level. These are all things we can easily switch up a few times a month that’ll essentially have a huge, positive effect in the long run.

All the pieces of climate crisis lead to this compact list of solutions in Project Drawdown. We have been talking about how fracking industry, agricultural industry and the consumerism culture have contributed to the climate crisis, and Project Drawdown is a comprehensive
                  <br><br>
 list of what we can do to mitigate the effect of climate change.
                  <br><br>
   I would be surprised to see that the majority of solutions are on land use and food if I hadn’t watched or read anything related to agriculture. To see how important it is to change the way we obtain food, process food and consume food is really interesting because it is not easy to think that the food we eat contributes so much to the climate crisis than other “obvious” factors like the burning of fossil fuels. This comprehensive list of solutions is a great source for educating people to change their lifestyle for the better or to push for change in policy or law in a right direction.
                  <br><br>
   What did surprise me however is “refrigerant management” is on the top of the list. We have been emphasizing so much in mass transit, agricultural change, behavioral change (especially eating) but having to manage our refrigerator and air conditioner use is something really doesn’t catch our attention—it is hard to imagine that air conditioner/refrigerator use contributes this much to the climate change, and I wish Ken could dive into this issue.

Reading the top 25 solutions for global emissions and watching Ken's video, I was amazed at how many solutions have to do with food and its production. I understood that food production accounted for a large majority of the greenhouse gas emissions that are being put into the atmosphere, but I was unaware at how crucial it is to take care of farm lands and change the common farming styles. The use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers being used on our everyday food has already been controversial due to its links with decreased sperm count, premature deaths and health issues, but after reading these summaries I realized that the use of these chemicals is killing the earth as well. Along with these chemicals, tilling the earth depletes it of its nutrients and believing that the soil is trash and no longer of use people abandon and locate new lands for their crops. I never realized how detrimental this abandonment could be for the environment until I read these summaries. Prior to reading I knew that extensive use of farm land would deplete it of its nutrients which is why farmers used to participate in cut-and-burn or alternating crop production, when these techniques decline though I am not sure. Alternating crops and utilizing crops with longer roots to bring nutrients to the shorter root crops is an amazing way at bringing back necessary nutrients to the soil and allowing for a carbon sink to re-develop within said farmland, helping with the daily emissions of carbon.
                  <br><br>

Like a few of these summaries and the impacts explained, changing the mindsets of these industries and their consumers would immensely change the amount of emissions going into the atmosphere even though its would be extremely costly. While I, and some of my fellow classmates may also be aware, that taking into consideration these global suggestions would help the climate extremely, we are aware that it is extremely hard to convince people to change their ways when, as of right now, they are "working". A lot of these industries want to spend the least amount of money as possible in order to gain more profit and after reading these summaries I understood that the vast majority of them are costly and their benefits, I do not believe would be enough to convince the producer to switch. It saddens me that our world is run by money hungry industries who only see the monetary benefits of their progresses and neglect the huge impacts that they have on the world. I too believe that many changes need to be made within the industry of food and its production, as on a list of 25 summaries for global change, 11 of them pertained to said industry and how we can change it for the better and the benefit of the world (I think that means its time to change the ways in which this industry is run).

In agreement with the following comment, when reading the top 25 solutions for global emissions I too was amazed at how many solutions have to do with food and the production of it. It was stated in the reading that, “the food we waste is responsible for roughly 8 percent of global emissions.” From reading the solutions I learned that emissions could be reduced as much as 63% by just adopting a vegetarian diet as well as one trillion could be saved in health care costs. Also, while reading and watching Ken’s video as well, I never really thought much about the importance of educating young girls. I was very surprised when I came across the fact that, “…including the United States where 45% of pregnancies are unintended.” These young women need to be educated in this subject so they can develop a better understanding of having children and family planning to prepare them for the future, as well as help, prevent a large number of unplanned pregnancies. As Ken mentioned in his video, six years ago there was a reported 3 billion population of people and it is reported that in 2050 that number will approach 10 billion.

Every time I read an assigned film, lecture, or reading I learn something new that I have not known before and then it makes me think of all the people that are in the same boat as me and if it was not for this class I would not know these things. This is what frightens me because I begin to think of the hundreds of people uneducated about this crisis and about food production and food waste which is the 2nd largest producer of greenhouse gases. Its saddening to see the rate our world is going in terms of destruction and knowing that it's in the hands of future generations to change this is quite stressful.

After reading 25 summaries on project drawdown I was surprised to learn the impacts of so many different things on the environment. I was also happy to learn that there are solutions to these climate problems. Some products as simple as a fridge I thought would never have an impact on the environment, but it does. Refrigerators were once one of the main culprits to destroying the ozone layer, but in 2017 many countries met and negotiated a deal to address the problem. This is very important because even though we still have so many problems today with climate change, the project drawdown made me realize that there were hundreds of problems that were fixed. This gives our generation hope to fix all the ongoing problems we are facing right now. I am also really happy that we are starting to read about positive impacts because it is inspiring for our generation to make a change.

I was also surprised by all the things that impact the environment and the solutions that there are to better climate crisis. I was not so surprised about the effects that refridgerators havee on the plannet. I was more shocked about the harm rice cultivation does to the earth and the percentage of greenhouse emission that it contributes. Yet I am glad about the four techniques to improve production and reduce emission. I am just hoping that the cultivators follow through with these techniques. 
                  <br><br>

I found thes redaing interesting to read especially because of the format. The summaries provided rich information. I like how they were straightfoward, making them easier to stay interested. However reading these makes me wonder when or if people are already implementing these solutions.



<br><hr>

I also didn’t know about the high energy consumption that refrigerators responsible for and by reading others’ comments, I can see that many of our classmates weren’t aware of this either. This reminded me of why most of us are in this class and are open to learning more and more about the climate crisis and what steps we can take going forward to implement change and how for some older generations who are close-minded about the idea can make a change too if they so choose. Although many young people know that the climate crisis is upon us, it doesn’t mean that we know about all its aspects. It’s really not only a generational problem, but it’s about being receptive to change and realizing why the climate crisis matters. It’s silly to think that we’re striking, changing our lifestyles, and taking a university class for something that is “not real”.

For starters, I completely agree that the digestable and solutions-based Project Drawdown reading has been one of my favorites so far and a welcome change from most of the content of the last few weeks. I also thought that the discussion of international collaboration with examples like the Montreal Protocol and summit in Rwanda illustrate that even some of the seemingly daunting global issues can be solved through collaboration. Furthermore, I appreciated that the project covers a wide variety of different types of solutions. For example, while some strategies, like regenerative agriculture and afforestation cover methods of ultimately going carbon-negative, strategies like the protection of peatlands also emphasize the importance of maintaining existing areas that work in the planet’s favor. 
                  <br><br>


Additionally, as Ken discussed in the video, this reading was more inspirational in nature because it provides individuals a framework to make several relatively small changes that would have a broad impact. By opting for a plant-based diet even just a few days every week and installing solar panels at home or even at our places of work, we as consumers can move to influence more of the socio-cultural based changes necessary to turn the plane’s condition around over time.

I was most shocked by the first two solutions presented in Project Dawndown. We've spent a good time talking about the food waste and plant based diets so those weren't shocking but we haven't really discussed how impactful refrigerant management and wind turbines can be. It was really nice to finally see a positive, a possible solution in this class. The stats given, for example the gigatons of CO2 saved, were numbing towards the end, but the point still got across. 
                  <br><br>

The improvement of how we make our food had a lot more dimensions than I previously thought. 11 of the 25 we read about had to do with food, whether was preventing waste or improving the way rice is grown, there seemed to be something that could be done to reduce emissions and increase efficiency in every aspect of farming. I got kind of confused on some of the food ones, specifically the ones involving trees. I felt there was a bit of overlap, which is probably beneficial. This in particular gave me hope that we can climb out of this hole. Something else that gave me hope was afforestation. I saw the Team Trees movement, with the help of many YouTube content creators blow up at the end of 2019 and while I'm sure it's a little different than afforestation it reminded me of the impact that we can make, especially when it's the 15th best solution possible. 
                  <br><br>

Something else I learned from this reading is that many of these solutions actually will save us money long run. The money excuse is often used to avoid taking action to reduce emissions, yet you will end up saving money by taking action. Maybe people will start seeing the saved capital as an incentive to decrease their carbon footprint

As you were shocked by the first two solutions, I accepted it very quickly. During high school, I lived with an American family. They are really nice people, but I was shocked by their use of AC and refrigerators. I grew up in a traditional Chinese family where my grandparents are really frugal. They thought opening an air conditioner for the whole night was really expensive. The meaning of using AC is just to help you to sleep. So every time when I open the AC and go to sleep, my grandma will turn it off before dawn. I know she does not tend to be environmentally-friendly, but after my middle school when I knew something about global warming, I accepted my grandma’s saving money action. Different from my family, my host family likes AC so much that the AC is always on even if nobody is home. I always feel confused that if no one is feeling the cool air, why do you need the AC on, though I enjoyed the “everywhere AC life”? 
                  <br><br>


Besides that, my host family has two refrigerators, one is in the kitchen for everyday foods, and one is in a garage which I don’t know its meaning yet. The garage refrigerator always has nothing but several bottles of water (I believe they can be fitted in the first refrigerators). This is not just a waste of energy, but the extra emission of greenhouse gases.

I really genuinely enjoyed reading the top 25 solutions for global emissions. All of the solutions were things that seem like they could be done with the right amount of effort and energy devoted to them. I thought that keeping each description short and sweet made me more inclined to scroll through each one because it was a condensed way of learning how we can implement changes to aid the climate crisis. Most readings we do are interesting to me, but I doubt the average American adult would ever spend that much time reading some of the longer articles we read in this class. That is why I believe websites like Project Drawdown are so important to the climate crisis because they provide a quick way to become informed in an interactive way. Educating the public about the climate crisis and solutions to solve the issue is probably one of the most important things that must be done in order to quickly reach a solution. The more information that is released and made public, the more we can engage the entire population of the earth to work as one team. Although some of the solutions are harder to implement and employ, it still is a solution. Some of the solutions may seem to be more expensive and labor heavy but honestly if the safety of our Earth is on the line, who cares?

I completely agree with you. The Project Drawdown site was very easy to use and appealing to the eye, which are important factors that hook a person in. Informing the public is one of the most important ways to help the climate crisis, so interactive websites like Project Drawdown are key to accomplishing this. Not only was the site easy to navigate through, but the descriptions of each solution were short and to the point, which is ideal for the lay audience.


For me, I’ve known about a lot of these solutions because of the environmental science class that I took in high school. However, I found it very interesting to see the ranking of each of these solutions. It’s helpful to see where our priorities should be because it’s hard to know exactly where to start. Many of these solutions seemed more achievable than others, but with the right attitude, I do believe that all of these can be accomplished. Educating the public is the number one way for this message to get across, so Project Drawdown is doing an incredible job of achieving that goal.

<br><hr>

Reading these solutions gave me a sense of hope and relief that there's still time to put in effort to better our planet. After being presented all these issues and events that have occurred in recent years, I felt as though we were doomed and nothing could be done. I also agree that making the effort to educate and spread this information to the public about the climate crisis and solutions is very important to do. I, for one, didn't know that eliminating HFCs is one of the top solutions. In addition, majority of these solutions involve food production and land use. I'm glad these solutions are accessible, but I still feel like we need to spread this info to a much larger audience through different mediums, but this is definitely a great start!


<br><hr>

I am with you on how the smaller solutions to climate change problems help keep the reader interested and still get the point across. While I knew about most of these solutions, there were some descriptions such as refrigerants and price cultivation that I was unaware of.  The information given was short but packed with everything I needed to know. Additionally, many of the solutions weren't as aggressive as some we've seen in this class. Like you said, educating the average American about subjects is necessary in order to put these solutions into effect, especially ones that tend to be forgotten. For example, the section talking how tropical forests cover only 5% due to their suffering of degradation, fragmentation, etc was surprising to hear as we mostly talk about the benefits of mass transportation and changing our diet. Problems like these are more important in my opinion to put out to the public since we tend to forget about the issues that don't directly concern us. Even though most of these solutions are pricey, the majority of the population loves to spend money on unnecessary things so I feel like there is no excuse to contribute in some way to help stop this issue.



<br><hr>

I was surprised that people have done so much work to look into different ways we can reverse climate change, and at how thorough they have been about how these methods can improve the planet.  There were a lot of things on the list that I have not thought of as solutions to climate change, like the solutions that involved changes to agriculture methods.  
                  <br><br>
After reading these solutions to the climate crisis, it seems very possible to at least start making change against climate change.  Many of these solutions not only seem logical, they have other benefits besides helping the environment.  Switching to a plant based diet does not only help reduce your carbon footprint, it also improves your health.  Crop rotation to prevent soil degradation not only allows for the crops to sequester carbon, it is beneficial to the farmer to have soil that is healthy. 
                  <br><br>
These solutions also do not seem that difficult to implement.  However, I think this way because I am not the person who would be working to implement these things.  Switching over to geothermal energy as a main source of energy seems like an obvious decision, but there are reasons as to why we have not already done that, and it is my unawareness of these reasons that make me question why these seemingly easy solutions have not been implemented.  To someone like me who does not know much about the climate crisis, it seems like there is no reason these solutions should be implemented because we are looking at these solutions from the perspective of someone who just wants the climate crisis to be fixed.

I'm really glad that this was the reading assignment for this week. It was really great to see a list of top solutions to reduce greenhouse gases. I liked how the list was ranked, and gave the impact as well as the brief description, making it an enjoyable read while also being extremely informative. Refrigerant management was really surprising to me to be the top way to cut back, as we haven't really talked about it all yet this course. What they said about HFCs having 1,000-9,000 times greater capacity to warm the planet than carbon dioxide was crazy. I didn't know that something so common could be that much worse than CO2, besides methane.
                  <br><br>


What didn't surprise me was that numbers 3 & 4 were food related. Number 4 being eating a plant-rich diet is the one that most people think of nowadays as a good way to reduce their personal carbon footprint, but number 3 being food waste was definitely an interesting one to bring up. Food waste is definitely a huge problem in the United States, as I believe Ken mentioned in a lecture that we waste over 2/3 of our food (although that could be wrong). That's just so sad and unnecessary, and an unbelievable harm to the environment, especially when other parts of the world aren't getting enough food.
                  <br><br>


This solution list was a nice eye opener, and gave me a lot of ideas of what I can do to lower my carbon footprint.

Your comment sums up my feelings about the reading, the rankings were so clear and important, and HFCs being more important to stop than CO2 was a huge surprise. Refrigerant management has never once even crossed my mind as a contributor to climate change.

                  <br><br>

It did surprise me however, that food-related changes took the number 3 and 4 spots. After reading about Refrigerant management, I was surprised by the almost mundane nature of switching to a plant-based diet. I figure that such a small lifestyle change (although likely drastic for many people) cannot really make a difference. Without sounding too cliche, small changes certainly can add up, if done consistently and broad scale. Thinking now on the impact that would have long run, it makes perfect sense. This reading helped push me to try new diets and definitely spread the word on refrigerant management!


<br><hr>
I also was glad to see this reading this week and enjoyed the organized and precise description of each solution in the list provided. 
                  <br><br>
I, too, like most people in the comments, was surprised to see that refrigerant management was the number 1 solution to cutting back carbon dioxide emissions and ultimately combating climate change. Not only because it hasn’t been mentioned in lecture or in the course, but also because it just doesn’t come to mind when we think about solutions to save the environment. 
                  <br><br>
3 and 4 didn’t surprise me either. Especially having watched the film and watching the lecture for this week. Food waste and the agricultural/cattle industry is a major problem that I feel like more people are aware of. Although it is scary and sad to know all the harm that has been caused to our environment anthropogenically, it is at least a little comforting to see a list like this one with real solutions that are laid out for us. I found it eye-opening as well, and I hope it helps others as well to be more aware of their impact on the planet.




<br><hr>
I completely agree, I felt that with this list of solutions gives those unaware or uniformed of the climate crisis gives people a broader perspective on it. One of the things that really resonated with me is food waste, I remember back at home how much my family would spend on groceries solely to let most of our fruits and vegetables to be thrown out because of mold growing on them. Or we would simply have leftovers sitting in the fridge for a good 3 weeks before being thrown out. Now that I am in college I am more cautious and aware of the amount of food I consume and making sure I don't let anything go to waste. However, I did notice the amount of food my roommate does dispose of because she lets it sit for days and doesn't bother eating it and so it simply goes to waste. Taking this approach of limiting my food waste is something I am trying to incorporate in my daily eating habits.

I though it was interesting how he Ken presented his ideas on how we could eliminate the footprint. Although he's mentioned these things before, it seems that the only way to real instill these principles of cutting individual footprints is to keep talking about the top solutions every time the topic is brought up. Switching to a plant based diet and reducing amounts of automobiles and the frequency of travel are both solutions that can be implemented at a large country scale, but require the efforts of the new generations to put that into effect. Realistically, this is very hard to accomplish, but even small scale changes at an individual level can certainly help. The top 25 things that will reduce the carbon footprint are often misleading because they don't help reduce and process carbon footprint, but instead work a way around, or pollute more in the process of.  Examples include electric and hybrid cards, and LED light bulbs.

I agree, Gabe. Many people often feel as if they have no options when it comes to lowering their footprint, which means they'd rather live their selfish lifestyles instead of taking the first steps to making the world a better place. To these individuals, I would tell them that they could look in almost all areas of their lives, and they could easily find opportunities to cut their overall emissions footprint. For instance, eating less meat and supporting local thrift stores are excellent ways to start lowering your footprint, while also eating healthy and being steezed out in the process. As mentioned in Project Drawdown, many politicians are ignoring the many alternatives that could be used to lower footprints across the country, even if they would prove to be more beneficial in other aspects other than environmentalism. If we could persuade politicians to help steer the U.S. to a more sustainable lifestyle, then potentially we could remove the label of the U.S. being one of the most unsustainable countries in the world.
                  <br><br>


Fortunately, however, we don't have to look too far in terms of seeing what lowering our overall footprint can do for the planet. Due to this coronavirus crisis, many countries' emissions are decreasing rapidly. For example, the nitrous oxide levels in China have dropped exponentially since the outbreak of the virus, which indicates the visibility in the air has gotten dramatically better. If this type of reduction could be witnessed in other countries, then we could make sure the world doesn't die off quicker than it's supposed to.

I agree. Large scale changes would be difficult to enact, largely because of the difficulty in changing societal norms while also hemorrhaging large amounts of money to fund the process. Some people also need cars to get to work because the infrastructure isn’t there yet. With more efficient and cost effective bus systems or easily accessed subway lines, driving is the only way to get to a job that could be hours away. I also think small changes do help. If one person doesn’t set a precedent, others won’t follow due to the potential risks that come with change. So convincing others with personal action is a powerful method.

I think greenwashing is a major problem in the United States. People often think they're composting, but in reality, the compostable bowl they used ends up being thrown away in the garbage. We need to do more. I agree that the best way to get information out there is to talk about it. I urge my parents to walk more and drive less on a daily basis.

Seeing a list of the top 25 things we can do to curve carbon emission made the goal to lower carbon emissions seem like a much more attainable goal. It's nice to see that we can lower many aspects of carbon emissions without completely stop using cars or any huge life changes. Based on the list it was nice to see how we can change so many things to lower the carbon emissions. These changes won't have drastic effects on every day life, however will change a lot for the environment. If we can do this we can not only curve the increasing carbon emission, but not have massive changes to the normal life and have people not support the movement. It's a pretty impressive that there are so many things we can do instead of moving to entire new areas or completely stop using our cars. I know that its a selfish reason but there are so many things that I didn't know were viable options to lower our carbon footprint.

The reading material provides us one hundreds means to reduce the emission of green house gas. Although there are many ways to protect our planet, only the top three will have a large impact on our environment. As Ken said, the most important thing we need to do is reducing the food waste. About one third to half of food we produced is wasted. If we began to save food and eat more vegetable, we will contribute more to our environment. According to the survey, the effect of reducing food waste is ten time fo switching LED light. Also, transportation is another primary emission of green house. Taking public transportation or riding bicycle are good for our planet. In then end, population also is very crucial for our climate. Female need to have the chance to be educated. The government should not ban the right of women to be educated. If the are fully educated, they will think whether they will give born of a children rather than just follow their husbands’ opinions. If the population can be controlled and increases slowly, the stress on environment will be smaller.

After reading about the 25 approaches of the summary of solutions I was impressed at how education of woman mattered so much. I always knew that education for woman has always been an issue but I had never thought that providing woman with education could positively impact the climate crisis. I can better understand the issue of population and compare it to this idea. I was also very impressed at the wind turbines offshore. I never even knew that was a thing. The Plant rich diet, although it is frequently mentioned, I now feel that it seems to be of major importance. I feel like changing into a plant-based diet will be hard in terms of it not being very favorable but I do think that it can be pretty successful since science is expanding so fast that I believe that finding a way to keep the taste of deliciousness in plants can be possible. I also think that as people continue to consume plant-based meals, they will eventually adapt to the taste and feeling and see it as normal. I feel like a plant-based diet would be the best place to start

Just like you, I am also impressed by this informative resolution of educating girls. When talking about the potential solutions to mitigate climate change and environmental problems, we often think about those common ones such as minimize your fast fashion consumption, live on a mostly plant-based diet, or use more public transportation. However, we often would not expect to see how education plays an important role in this crucial issue. This resolution is logical, reasonable, and feasible, which brings more light into solving the problem at its root. By promoting accessible education for girls, especially in developing countries, it would delay the time of their marriage, as well as delaying the time of having the first child. It is evident that the higher the level of education that a girl receives, the fewer, and healthier children that she will give birth to. This will very much result in a benevolent cycle, making progress in slowly stabling the insane population on our planet. Moreover, the spread of accessible education will also see an improvement in gender equality, reducing crimes, infant mortality rate, and sex-related diseases. Overall, the link between women’s education and the climate crisis is a really exciting place to start from, which can also help to improve many other societal problems.

I enjoyed and was very grateful for the list provided on the most effective ways to cut down CO2 emissions. I had knowledge on HFCs and CFCs due to past environmental classes, but up to this reading I completely forgot about them and their negative impact on the environment. Knowledge about HFCs and CFCs and their impact on our planet is not common knowledge, and many are not aware, nor go seek out this information. This goes back to the point of education, we need to educate the public on these issues, making them more aware of things like HFCs. It is still even crazy to me how much CO2 refrigeration puts into the atmosphere. 
                  <br><br>

Growing up one thing that was always seen as a way to make a difference in the environment is switching light bulbs and driving electric cars, and it is funny how we continue to press these ideas, when there are other, bigger CO2 producers and switches one can make to lower their carbon footprint. This is so crazy to me. Our planet could be doing so much more to make a change, but we continue to press ideas on the population that are making not a larger impact than others. It all comes down to what people want to hear and what will make the people in higher power more money; why aren’t we talking about HFCs when discussing the climate crisis, or switching to plant based diets, or fast fashion, or even reducing flying? When instead all we talk about is switching to solar, or driving an electric car, or switching your light bulbs. Don’t get me wrong, every little thing helps when trying to better this environment, but why is nobody educating others on the bigger CO2 emitters and how to reduce one’s carbon footprint even greater?

Jayce, I also was really appreciative of this list that provided so many ways in which to cut down CO2 emissions! It almost leaves us with no excuse to not participate in at least one of these ways to help the climate. Just as you note that our culture relies on blaming others for the high CO2 emissions, this list hopefully makes the average person  realize that yes, it is a lot of people's fault but maybe its my own too. I think this realization in owning up to the fact that we all have a part in the problem is much needed if anything major is going to be done to help the climate crisis.

I’ve learned about CFCs and HFCs in another course (EARTH 130) in the past but I didn’t know it would top the list of the “roadmap” to reduce greenhouse gas emission. Ken’s video was informative in terms of knowing that the top 3 solutions should be our focus because they would be more effective than the bottom 75 solutions combined. I’m also introduced to terms that I’ve never even heard of before such as silvopasture and peatlands. I’m not surprised that wind turbines are slowly integrating into mainstream electricity source. It’s great that the price of wind energy is getting cheaper and more affordable. Whenever someone said wind turbines, all I can picture is the field of wind turbines on the way to Indio and Palm Springs. The challenge to expand more wind turbines in the future is to find the ideal location because the variable nature of wind is unpredictable. I knew reducing food waste was integral to reducing greenhouse gas emission, but I didn’t know it would be more important than switching to a plant-rich diet. For the past few weeks, I’ve been very conscious about how much food I make and if I make extra, I will always save it for the next meal. 
                  <br><br>

Even though educating girls and family planning didn’t make it to the top three individually but combining these two factors would make it the top 2 and roll back 103 gigatons of carbon dioxide. I think it’s extremely crucial to provide the opportunities for girls to learn more about sex ed and access to contraception. I was shocked to learn that 45% of pregnancies are unintended in the US because US isn’t a developing country and I would think people are more careful. There are options like plan B and other birth control methods besides using a condom. Girls can protect themselves using IUD or birth control pills, but I have a feeling that not everyone knows this. I’m lucky that I had a sex ed class during freshman year of my high school. Even though it was awkward, but the information was so much more important than just kids giggling. Lastly, I want to draw attention to the tropical forests. It’s already depressing that the size of tropical forests left is dwindling but the deforestation in Indonesia to make space for palm oil plantation is so inhumane to the environment and the lives that depend upon it.

I like the way you mentioned that if you combine “Educating Girls” and “Family Planning” together, it will be number 1 on the list. In many ways, these two topics are closely related. An improvement in one area will lead to the improvement in the other. It’s important to note that these are more long-term solutions, as opposed to other technologies or reformations that can be implemented relatively quickly. I think people tend to ignore the long-term solutions because they want to see fast results, yet long-term solutions are the most important in my opinion. We need to keep in mind that the climate crisis will probably be prevalent for entire lifetime, so the future leaders of our world must be educated now in order to continue the progress that our generation has begun.
                  <br><br>
As you said, basic sex ed classes can be simple, yet incredibly beneficial for women. A few mandatory classes during their teenage years can be cheap, but provide them with the knowledge and means to prevent unwanted pregnancy. Of course, both genders should be educated on the consequences of the lack of family planning. I believe that after high school, sex ed should be made mandatory to every person in order to reiterate and stress the boundless benefits of family planning.

I appreciated this week's reading as it showed solutions to the problems we’ve been learning for the past five weeks. The website was simple, listing the things we can change in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I found it interesting that reducing CFCs and HCFCs is the number one thing we can do to reduce emissions and yet it’s never mentioned by the media. Everyone thinks the biggest thing we can do to combat climate change is switch to an electric vehicle when it, in fact, is ranked number twenty six on the reading. The first time and last time I had heard of chlorofluorocarbons was in my AP Environmental Science class senior year. We don’t often think about an aerosol can or our refrigerator being a leading cause of climate change. 
                  <br><br>

Two of the twenty five solutions that stood out to me were educating women and family planning. With the earth's population growing exponentially, it is soon to reach a carrying capacity. Hopefully, however, it won’t get to that point and less kids will be born per family. Educating women is a great way to control population, as educated women often wait longer to have kids and often have less than uneducated women. Beyond this population talk, educating women in general is important socially and economically. Family planning is also an important part of controlling the population. As Ken said in his video “there are roughly twenty five million unplanned pregnancies every year.” Many men and women don’t have access to contraceptives or healthcare, leading to these unplanned pregnancies. 
                  <br><br>

I was surprised that most of the top twenty five solutions revolved around the food sector. The two most impactful solutions are reducing food waste and switching to a plant based diet. These two alone would reduce one hundred and forty gigatons of CO2 emissions. This makes it seem as though changing our diets would have a large impact on the environment and is worth considering.

I agree that Project Drawdown was very helpful in giving solutions to the 
                  <br><br>
climate crisis. I was also surprised at how chemical refrigerants produce so much greenhouse emissions. I knew about the Montreal Protocol but I didn't know that HFC's were still a major problem. It is good that we are starting to phase them out. It was interesting to see how reducing food waste and eating a more plant-based diet was much more effective in reducing emissions than solar, geothermal, or nuclear energy. I feel like reducing food waste is very important since we are wasting lots of resources on food that will never be eaten. We have to find a way to distribute food to people that need it. This will reduce waste and feed people. I agree that educating women and family planning are important. It will reduce the amount of unplanned pregnancies and allow families to decide if they want to have kids or not.


<br><hr>
I also found many of the top ways in which we can decrease carbon emissions and help mitigate the climate crisis to be very interesting. Amongst the many ways, I also noticed that a lot of what we can do to help bring down carbon emissions is food-related. This definitely calls for some change in the food industry, considering how much pollution food contributes to the environment every year. Surprisingly, I thought it was interesting that the number one way in which we can help the environment is actually through refrigerant management. It was also very interesting to hear that the top three solutions are more effective than the bottom 75. This statistic really puts into perspective what we, as a society, should be prioritizing when we talk about the climate crisis. This diverse and surprising list of solutions goes to show just how small innovations and changes to certain industries and habits can go a long way in greatly and significantly reducing the world’s carbon emissions. 

                  <br><br>

But just how feasible are these solutions? Although the reading outlines specifically what we can do to help mitigate carbon emissions, will people really be willing to make these changes? Although I liked how the reading also offered the pros and the extra benefits that can come from these solutions, some still seemed too idealistic for it to happen in the near future. One important solution that I feel is necessary to not only help the environment but also  humanity is the education of women and the raising of awareness of family planning. Both of these address one of the main concerns of climate change; population growth. With making education accessible to all women around the world, this not only benefits them in helping to prevent poverty, disease, and other negative consequences due to the lack of education, but it also helps to prevent unwanted pregnancies and helps to naturally control the population. Coupled with family planning, I believe that these are actually great ways to start in helping the issue of climate change because it has the best chance of getting public support and funding since it directly has to do with other people through more affordable and accessible education. I feel like more people would be willing to support the expansion of education for women rather than making more solar panels and protecting peatlands.

I agree, it was very interesting to be given clear cut examples of solutions to the problems we've been discussing in class.  Earlier in the year Ken mentioned that based on how the class is structured he hoped that we would have more hope as the quarter progressed.  It seems as though we are finally getting to the point where we can feel some relief.  Project Drawdown is probably the best list of solutions we've been given during our time learning about the climate crisis.  As for the solutions that stood out to you I completely agree with those as well.  Educating women is something that needs to be done in general - socially and economically.  Once people understand that then the climate can benefit as well.  Family planning is something that can be done easily if people would realize that there are little to no negatives on providing men and women with sex education, access to contraceptives, and making places like planned parenthood more socially accepted.

As a student from stem major, I’m more than glad to read the 100 solutions listed. Finally, enough of all these depressing moaning and groaning, something practical has come.
                  <br><br>

What intrigues me the most among all these possible solutions is the “educating girls and avoiding emission by curbing population growth through such process.” The main reason why I am so in favor of this solution is because most of the ways Ken proposed to address the issue of climate crisis is an impairment of human rights. Whether it is discouraging people from consuming meat or making us feel guilty when flying anywhere. However, making an effort in education is life-changing to the receiver of such education and would  no doubt give them a better life. 
                  <br><br>

Some might still have concerns about how educating girls might work in curbing the growth of population. I can prove this point using the data of recent birth rates in China. As is known to all, the chinese government has been conducting the one-child policy for over 30 years and has recently converted the policy to 2-child. However, the vast majority didn’t respond to such policy as expected and the birth rate kept low. The main reason why such a phenomenon took place is that during the 30 years, not only did the economic growth allow more educational opportunities for girls but the one-child policy also had the whole family invest in their only child, therefore, girls are more educated than their former generation. The data indicates that such change unintentionally contributes to a lower reproduction rate and thus curb the growth of population.

I have the same idea with you considering the Educating Girls and Family Planning solutions proposed by Drawdown. When reading the “Summary of Solutions” from Project Drawdown, I am impressed by its organized articles which include sections of Introduction, Methodology, Adoptions Scenarios, Results, and Discussion. It brings me a comprehensive understanding of the system of reducing CO2 emissions with clear methods and statistics. Ken’s lecture also informs me that reducing food waste could be 10 times more efficient than switching to LED light bulbs. Land use also intertwines with food waste, being one of the most important global climate issue. Nevertheless, some scenarios look nearly impossible to me, such as the Drawdown Scenario showing a 75 percent reduction in total global food loss and wastage by 2050 and the Optimum Scenario indicating a 100 percent reduction in total global food loss and wastage aligned with the Zero Hunger Challenge. Among these solutions, the most significant one hat I notice includes Educating Girls and Family Planning. 
                  <br><br>

    As an international student come from China, I have deep feeling about the necessity of education and birth control, especially for these developing areas. Chinese government starting family planning policy about 40 years ago, asking each family to have only one child. Although many people didn’t understand this polity at that time, most of Chinese realize the benefit of birth control now. This policy obviously increases the average level of education, promotes the economic development, and contributes to the environment. As more girls in rural area in China get education, less of them want to have two or more children. Notwithstanding, China still has huge population. I could deeply feel the disadvantage of an excess of population, such as traffic congestion, industrial pollution, and uneven distribution of population’s quality. I definitely agree with Project Drawdown to make effort to mitigate greenhouse emissions.

Project Drawdown lists lots of ways to reduce CO2 emission, and the most effective way is refrigerant management. Especially, people should dispose refrigerant carefully since 90% of its emissions happens at end of life. Furthermore, it is quite astonishing that proper land usage can mitigate the climate crisis. For instance, people can change the way they cultivating, grazing,  and planting. By intercropping trees and crops, trees can uptake nutrition from the soil and build windbreak to protect soil from erosion. Also, by using migratory grazing, the land will have time to recover. Moreover, by planting more trees which can stabilize the soil and absorb CO2. In addition, the abandoned land is a key which should be restored since it can be utilized to sink CO2. However, if farmland is abandoned, the soil will be eroded, and the farmland will be a source of CO2 emissions. Not only land should be treated properly, but clear energy should be employed efficiently. Solar energy can be transferred to electricity easily through a solar panel, and the price of a solar panel keeps going down, low-income can utilize the solar panel to make electricity affordable. Food waste also produces lots of CO2. There are two kinds of countries waste food. The low-income countries waste food unintentionally, because the food will spoil during storage and distribution since the technology of storage is not advanced. The high-income countries waste food intentionally, because food retailers and consumers refuse food based on bumps, bruises, and colors. Additionally, girls and women should have the access to education. Family planning is very important to control the world population.
                    <br><br>
   The lecture suggests that the climate crisis can be solved from two aspects, personal and collective. A person can reduce his/her CO2 footprint by just changing his/her lifestyle like transportation, housing, and eating. Ken points out people can collectively solve the crisis by doing the ways listed on Project Drawdown. Additionally, he mentions the first three methods are much effective than the summation of rest solutions, and land usage is quite important to reverse the climate crisis. In my perspective, it is urgent to change our way to treat farmland. I believe we should adopt a sustainable way that can make people avoid going to extinction.

In my opinion, plant-based diet and prevention of food waste can alleviate our serious environmental problems to some extent, but here I want to question Ken for the first time. It's true and effective, but how bad can it be? In my opinion, the impact will not be great after all. I'm glad to see some solutions to these problems and some very positive forecast data, but I still have to question whether these can be achieved in the end.
                    <br><br>
No matter to prevent waste or to change the way of rice planting, these can solve the problem. But I don't think we should expect too much from these solutions. Because people are like this, we have to consider one thing from many aspects. For example, we have developed a method to change the way of rice planting, but we need to invest a lot of R &amp; D funds. In the process of R &amp; D, it may also pollute the environment. At the same time, the implementation in some underdeveloped areas will bring a lot of financial pressure to the local people and the government. So I don't think we can put all the eggs in the same basket. At present, these solutions are not mature enough. We need to work harder to find better ways.

I really enjoyed this week's reading as it simply got to the point of what needs to change in order to save the planet. The solutions to all of these problems are clearly listed in these summaries, and even changing one's lifestyle through a couple of these problems such as changing one's diet or managing one's energy use through their air conditioning can drastically change one's carbon footprint. It was also very eyeopening to see that some of the issues are really based off of education and how we can help other parts of the world be more sustainable and healthy in order to protect the environment and themselves. For example, some of the world relies on solid fuel cook stoves which amount to a large part of their indoor air pollution, and switching to a cleaner stove such as solar power would be a big change in one's carbon footprint and health. Another big part that I think is realistic for helping for the environment would be the use of education of women's health in order to regulate the population of the Earth. Not only would a smaller population be more sustainable for the planet, but also improve the standard of living for all women across the globe. Thank you for sharing such an informative reading for this week.

I thought the reading for this week was great as well. I really appreciated how clear it was. It was encouraging to see how many things can be done to reduce emissions, and how possible they are. I was surprised to see that their top solution had to do with changing refrigerants. All of the things about agriculture, diet, and electricity productions were expected, but I never really thought about the greenhouse effects of refrigerants. I also appreciated the information about how much certain actions would produce in savings, and the estimated costs.

After reading the different solutions proposed by the project, I’m left feeling optimistic about the future. It’s encouraging to see so many comprehensive and viable solutions together in one place. I think a major problem with promoting sustainability is the limited relevance it has to everyone. If there was a commercial discussing the chemicals released by refrigerators and air conditions, it might only affect the few environmentally conscious people who are in the market for a new AC. Therefore, despite its importance, more emphasis and focus are put on more encompassing solutions which everyone can potentially take part of such as using less water and wasting less food. Therefore, some, more niche solutions which are nonetheless important can become overlooked. So, it’s very encouraging to see Project Drawdown which offers so many solutions that anyone can take something away from it and live more sustainably. That being said, I think the film effectively puts into perspective what’s actually impactful and what isn’t. The fact that reducing food waste vastly outweighs the benefits of switching to LED lights is evident of the fact that not all effort is enough. There are many things that a modern American can change which will affect the planet in varying degrees. Therefore, its highly important to do the right thing.

After reading the first 25 approaches from the “Summary of Solutions” from Project Drawdown, I also felt more optimistic and the blueprint of resolving the climate crisis in the future has become clearer to me. I like the way it organized the inspiring list of solutions addressing each problem of the climate crisis from the summaries to the significant statistics then to the possible predicted outcomes. Prior to reading this list, I never thought about refrigerants would be a major concern for global warming and HFCs have 1,000 to 9,000 times greater capacity to warm the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. I also learned that 90% of the refrigerant emission comes from the end of devices’ lives, which indicates that it emits a great deal of greenhouse gases during the disposal of those abandoned devices. If more people choose eco-friendly refrigerants, human would be able to take another big step in mitigating the climate crisis. What’s more, I was not surprised to learn that reducing food waste and switching to a plant-based diet would have a larger impact than any other solutions on the list. The amount of food waste I see every day is staggering, whether it’s in the school cafeteria or in the restaurant off campus. It was really heartbreaking…so the education on how to avoid food waste needs to be greatly strengthened.

Project Drawdown is a comprehensive, straightforward list of solutions for the climate crisis. The solutions are listed in order, each link addressing the problem faced and the impact of the solution. The document design is clear and easy to read, which allows it to be easily understood. There are also a lot of surprises on the document. For one, as Ken points out, the media never covers the topic of refrigerant management with HFCs, even though it is an extremely important issue. Switching from HFCs to natural refrigerants like propane is the number one thing we can do collectively to reduce CO2 emissions. The technology is already there, yet all that ever reaches the news is updates on electric cars, which only makes number 49 on the list. Another interesting thing I noticed was wind turbines being number 2 on this list. I would have assumed solar and nuclear energy would be above this. Wind energy is easy has competitive prices, produces no emissions, and uses only a small fraction of land. Project drawdown cites that an increase in wind energy to just 21.6% from the current 4% would reduce CO2 emission by 84.6 gigatons. And that would just be the beginning of wind energy. Another interesting outlook that I had never considered is the impact of educating women and family planning. These two things combined make #1 on the list, and will not only increase the quality of life but help reduce population and global emissions. There were some other surprising and impactful things on the list like improved rice cultivation, managed grazing and other topics to do with food and land. These are all things that as a collective we can begin to push for. Overall, I find this document brings some optimism to the climate crisis. Although there are some who don’t believe in climate change, and others who support their own agenda over the planets, this list brings hope. It’s full of real science and real solutions to the problem.

I agree – after going through the Summary of Solutions, it was very interesting to see that refrigerant was the number one issue facing climate change; it was also rather helpful that all the solutions are in order, and can easily show the cost of the problem and the solutions available. We often hear about the larger issues contributing to climate change, such as fracking or flying, but rarely what we can do to help with the smaller ones. Additionally, as you point out, it was interesting to see educating girls and family planning on that list; as Professor Hiltner talked about in class, education is one of the key ways we can help change our planet, one bit at a time.

From the list of first 25 approaches for solution, I surely get to know something I did not know before. I knew that turning off the light and going to work by public transportation can protect the environment, but what I feel very surprised is that I do not know the usage of refrigerant can be significantly effective to the environment. In the list. I saw lots of the things the most people were mentioned about like plant-based diet or controlling population, refrigerant is the one thing I never thinking that related to the environment. It is pretty impressive if the government can have more regulations and laws to manage the after-use refrigerant like the leakage and recovery, the huge amount of co2 will not emission to the atmosphere. 
                     <br><br>

The second solution in the list that attracts me is girl’s education. It says that if the girls from poor area can be provided educational opportunities, they may control the size of their future families. From my perspective, it is not only women’s business to have control on baby, both man and women have the responsibility to control the baby by contraception. So, I think instead of providing these girls changes to get education, everyone should get more educational idea about what population controlling weights in the protecting environment. More teachers should teach children to protect the planet.

I wholeheartedly agree that educating girls, especially those from less fortunate countries and communities, should be a top priority. Based on the information provided by Project Drawdown, it seems like more government-funded public schools need to be built to increase accessibility travel-wise and bring down costs so that virtually any child, boy or girl, has access to a proper education, which seems quite feasible if sufficient funds are allocated; in addition, it would create more jobs for these nations, employing construction workers to build the schools and teachers and administrators to run the school and teach the next generation, reducing unemployment and reinvesting in their economies. As you said, educating girls allows them to make more informed decisions regarding family planning. As Ken has mentioned various times throughout this course, curbing population growth by reducing the number of children one has to 2 or less greatly reduces our carbon footprint, considering we suffer from an inability to properly sustain our current world population of nearly 8 billion people as is. I completely agree with you that it is up to both men and women to practice safe sex and use contraception as much as possible to prevent unwanted pregnancies; greater availability of condoms and birth control, both in terms of distribution and cost (ideally as low as possible if not free), would be a welcome step in the right direction. Taking into account the random dispersion of rural communities within many developing countries means that change would ideally come in the form of grassroots movements that encourage environmentally-friendly practices like implementing clean-energy infrastructure, wind turbines being one of the top 10 solutions proposed by Drawdown. Should action be taken in these areas, it is extremely likely that we can promote the stable, sustainable development of a variety of developing nations across the globe rather than the destructive, rapid development seen during the Industrial Revolution that completely transformed the United States and Europe.

I really enjoyed reading the approaches from the “Summary of Solutions” from Project Drawdown because it was very clear and informational. It was really easy for me to understand each issue with the solutions and impacts provided. I was pretty surprised to learn that the  number one solution in reducing CO2 had to do with refrigerator and air conditioning chemical refrigerants. I had previously heard that this was an issue, but I had not realized how big of an issue it was. The other solution that I was most surprised to learn was the solution of educating girls. It does make sense that by educating girls, population growth that causes additional emissions could be curbed, but it was something that I had not thought about before. I think these solutions were especially surprising because these top solutions are ones that are not very well known to the general public compared to solutions like electric vehicles that are not even in the top 25 of the solutions. I think it is pretty important that 11 out of the top 25 solutions has to do with food. This shows how significant a change to our diets can have on CO2 emissions. This list by Project Drawdown proposed many solutions that make me hopeful in the possible changes we can make to reduce emissions and save our planet.

When reading the approaches from the "Summary of Solutions" from Project Drawdown, I was also surprised at the results. I did not expect to see Refrigerant Management as number 1. To be honest, I did not even know it was an issue. After reading this, I feel well informed about some of the solutions and the way CO2 can be reduced.  I imagined at first seeing something like electric cars on top of the list. Overall, this reading is very informational. We are able to look at ways we can reduce our carbon footprint at the personal level and at the global level. I find this reading to be useful and very effective because it introduces approaches that some of us might of never heard of, or probably did not know much about. With these approaches, we have a better understanding of the climate crisis and ways that we can possibly alter our lives and influence others to do the same. For instance, we can change our lives by wasting less food and better preserving it. Furthermore, it is important to note the fact that many of these solutions are probably not known to an average person. After reading the "Summary of Solutions," I thought about how we can change the fact that these solutions aren't even considered. As students, we can take these approaches and take action.

This week's reading was the most enjoyable, interesting, and concise reading assigned so far. I loved how the list had a simple format with a brief, yet clear and informative summary, followed by a specific, quantitative impact that the change would have. As compared to some other articles like Thoreau that went on and on about things that seemed irrelevant to the climate crisis, Project Drawdown's list was hopeful and provided explicit the most effective ways to fight global warming. I also loved the pictures that accompanied each solution which showed me how solutions such as silvopasture and offshore wind turbines looked like when implemented, so I could visually see places where the technology or technique is already being used. 
                     <br><br>


The things that surprised me the most about the list was how such a large amount of solutions were related to agriculture or food. 11 of 25 of the items on the list were food-related, while there wasn't a single solution on the top 25 that dealt with cars or transportation. I've always mentally related the climate crisis with vehicle CO2 emission, but this list made me realize that the food sector has a lot bigger impact than I expected. I also noticed that unlike the other weeks, this list doesn't call on individuals to change their lifestyles or actions to solve the climate crisis, rather it points out areas in infrastructure and agricultural techniques that could be improved. The gigatons of CO2 that industry-wide reform could save greatly overshadows the individual reductions of CO2. To me, this further stresses the importance of voting for the implementation of environmentally friendly policies and politicians.

I definitely agree with you that this week's reading was much more enjoyable than the rest, for it was a comprehensive, straight forward plan of things that we could do to drastically combat the climate crisis. I too also thought that the main killer to this earth was that of cars and planes and fracking, but with this reading as well as "Cowspiracy", I realized that livestock contributes much more harm to our environment. 1/3 of the food raised is wasted before it can even be eaten, and it contributes to 8% of emission. The method of Silvopasture would greatly reduce waste. However, I disagree with how you say that this list does not call for individual actions. I think it does. Although it might be discouraging to think that since the food sector produces so much greenhouse gases, there's nothing I can do to combat it. Well, you can, by eating less meat (If you aren't vegan/ vegetarian already, I'm assuming, so correct me if I'm wrong and also I am pointing to all as a whole, not just you). It's simple economics, supply and demand. People stop eating less meat and the food sector will stop producing. I really do not think giving this responsibility to politicians is a good idea because as we can see throughout history, often their fear of not getting reelected prevents them from enforcing policies that they believe in. They don't change unless we change first. But yes, it is important to vote green, but it is also crucial to practice what you preach and support the climate through individual actions.


<br><hr>

Like you, I was very pleased and really, genuinely enjoyed this week's reading. Throughout the class we have been pounded with different statistics, stories, visuals, and other forms of information that suggest we are past the point of no return and that our Earth's destruction is not a matter of if but instead of when. It is reassuring reading projects like Project Drawdown that show that we can reverse what we have done, and how we can do it. I too also really enjoyed the structure of the project. It is formatted in a way that I feel like a lot of people could read and comprehend, and the I also found the visuals very important for me to see what these suggested changes would look life in real life. Seeing solutions imagined like the ones you mention, silvopasture and offshore wind turbines, really inspires hope that there are solutions to the problems we face.
                     <br><br>


To add on to what you say about the focus of each solution, I was also surprised by how many of the top 25 solutions were food-related. I think that a lot of people aren't really aware of this fact, and priorities are placed on other issues such as transportation when, in reality, we use transportation as a method for moving consumer goods such as meat and other foods that could be produced locally instead. 
                     <br><br>


Another important issue that is discussed by the project which I think is important to address is the education of girls worldwide. Our population continues to grow, but the rate at which it grows can be slowed down as 25 million unplanned pregnancies happen every year. Education about contraceptives is crucial if we want to slow our population growth, but many girls in developing countries do not have access to this resource. Many don't even have access to any form of formal education at all, and this is a much bigger social issue that needs to be addressed. The fact that this problem is so high on the list of solutions, #6, shows that problems such as poverty and gender-inequality, among others, are connected to larger environmental issues and that they can help fix each other if properly addressed by starting with systematic institutions that help perpetuate these problems that plague our modern world.

This reading, Project Drawdown, is a list that I am looking for for a long time- a list that provides the solutions for climate crisis. It is basically ranked by the percentage it contributes in the carbon emission. Among the list, it is clear that technology change plays a major rule. Electronic car is one of the solutions. Although it releases more carbon dioxide during the production, its overall carbon emission is certainly less than non-electric cars. Promotion of electric cars certainly needs real investment from government. Speaking of this, China sets a very good model. Chinese government launched subsidies for both of the production and consumption of electric cars in the market. This encourages the consumption of electric cars in Chinese market in a large degree. I mean, if China can do that, why cannot the rest of the world, at least the developed countries? Why is the US still encouraging voting for the ones who will set carbon tax, instead of already setting it? To reduce carbon release, behavioral change is another influencing factor to think of. Not eating meat is one way to reduce carbon release due to animal agriculture.

Before reading through this book, all the things we watched, read, and learned were reveal the effects that human's actions or some disasters posed to the environment. Transportation, housing, food, almost every aspects of our life have accelerated the increment of carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere. Climate crisis has become a serious problem for all living things in this planet, and we are concerning about this problem.

                     <br><br>

However, this is the first time that I read something related to solutions of climate crisis, though it only analyzes from perspective of food. I could not imagine that food is responsible for 8% of global emission. Although 8% looks like a small percentage, we need to consider how much carbon dioxide we emit every year. This book is pointing at waste food instead of food cultivation. Both rich and poor countries need to face food waste problem. For rich countries, people will not pay more attention to buying food rationally or eating food as soon as possible, because they have enough money to buy the food they want and their countries have enough land to cultivate more food for their citizens. In poor countries, first of all, people always prefer to buy more food once they have access to it, but they never think that they do not have reliable method to store those food. This is one of the reasons. Another reason is that the quality of their countries' land is extremely bad, so the food may not be available for eating. These are two main resources for food waste.

                     <br><br>

I find that climate problem is always connecting with economic problem. Once we begin to solve food waste problem by building better systems in poor countries to store food, improving land quality by using some chemical fertilizers, or advocating people to limit the amount of food in home, the economy will develop quickly. The reason behind it is that more healthy food production could promote imports and exports. Many unemployed people could also find job in the food industries which could increase employment rate. In conclusion, solve food waste problem could improve both economy and climate. This is the best solution and development we would like to see.

I agree with this comment that we need to rapidly invest our time in rearranging our system of food production in an attempt to help the climate crisis. The fact that if we restructure the way we distribute and judge our food we can make a huge difference.  I do find that everyone can partake in reducing food waste. The statistic that stood out to me was  how “globally reducing food waste can have nearly ten times the impact of switching to LED light bulbs.” We don’t really think about how the food we waste hurts our planet and really need to start taking into account that every apple in our grocery stores does not need to be perfectly round and shiny. “Retailers and consumers reject food based on bumps, bruises, and coloring, or simply order, buy, and serve too much.” This quote really bothered me because it is so dumb to look at food and decide that you don’t want to eat it because it looks a certain way, it all tastes the same, it is something you consume and never see again. Back at home, there is this farm called G.R.U.B which grows its own food and takes in rejected organic produce from grocery stores to sell at the farmers market. If we make more of an effort to invest into businesses such as these, which repurpose the food that huge corporations decide they are going to throw out for us, we can make a difference right in our homes. However, after realizing this and researching the options around the SB/LA area, I found that there is an issue with these companies themselves: they are classist in their work. In the article from The Atlantic, they discuss how these repurposed foods are generally sourced from big companies, leaving local farms behind and working-class people behind as these “progressive” start-ups come at a high priced subscription each month. However, though this is true, I still feel as if the fact that they even exist gives a little leverage to the waste that is created if they did not exist. (https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/01/ugly-produce-startups-food-waste/581182/) Misfits Market, mentioned in the article has gone a step further though, with targeting local farms that do not meet restaurant/grocery standards to sell and distribute produce in a economically efficient way. Though a complicated problem, these small choices we make can help us limit how much food we are wasting day to day.

I am pleasantly surprised with this class and with Ken because instead of teaching us solely what the climate crisis was and what is happening to the earth, he is making sure that we know what we can do to fix it. The amount of unplanned pregnancies is astronomical considering that we need to have some sort of population control. The lack of affordable birth control is as well. Starting with educating women and simply having a better system for birth control and contraceptives and making them more affordable will essentially help the problem without forcing people to have fewer kids. This article was one of the most beneficial to read and something that I would recommend to someone who is interested in the climate crisis. It was easy to read, informative, not very long and drawn out. It was simple and a lot of the stuff is things that we can implement easily into our daily lives, for example eating a plant-based diet. Silvopasture is also a good option because we can also allow people who are are culturally obligated to eat meat to continue to do so as well. We can implement some of these policies as things that politicians can make happen and everyone can get behind in some sense. For example, affordable birth control. The argument is always abortion, but I think everyone can get behind affordable birth control which then has an effect on population control, which has an effect on the environment without having to create a law limiting the number of children that people can have. 
                     <br><br>

I thought that this whole article was very interesting and I'm glad that we had to read it. Yes, reusable water bottles and light bulbs and unplugging your phone charger is all-important, but we need more drastic change for this to be effective.

Project drawdown was such an interesting “reading.” There are two things that I can say caught my attention the most. The first being that refrigerant management is at the top of the list for solutions to our ongoing climate crisis. The issue of refrigerant management did not cross my mind as the number 1...hell, it would not have even made my top 10 if I had to make a list. But after reading about its impact and how much atmospheric CO2 could be reduced, I better understand how big of an issue it is. Seeing this reminded me of the fact that a lot of pollution comes from industrial processes. 


The other thing that caught my attention was how high up the categories of “educating girls” and “family planning” were. While I already understood the importance of education for girls, I did not realize how important it was to reduce our carbon emissions. As it was stated in the impact statements in each category, it seems like a domino effect-as girls become more educated they are less likely to marry as children or against their will. This, along with family planning, would lead to fewer carbon emissions because there would literally be fewer babies being born.


I am thankful that something like project drawdown was created. As Ken said in this video, it is very helpful to have this kind of “road-map” or “to-do list” to help us tackle the big issues relating to the climate crisis.

I totally agree with you. I never would have linked refrigeration management to the climate crisis, nonetheless making it the number one issue on the list. I feel that it is important for many consumers to know that refrigerators release 90 percent of their CO2 emissions at the end of their lifetime, and that there are ways to prevent or reduce this percentage with the proper steps taken to care for getting rid or fixing an old fridge. I also enjoyed how detailed this article was about providing education and planned parenthood for girls in countries that might not have the same resources or outlets available to them. Although Ken has mentioned it quite a bit in his class, generally speaking, I don't think it is often considered when trying to find ways to combat climate change. I found this site to be extremely helpful and like you, believe that sources like this could help us tackle larger scaled issues.


<br><hr>
In response to David, these two aspects caught my attention immediately as well. The significance of just managing refrigeration itself is crazy to imagine the impact it has. Like David mentioned, I would have never thought it’d be at the top of the list of ways to fix the climate crisis. Realizing that controlling the energy exerted from machines like such, along with cutting down on the mass CO2 being expelled through the production of these things as well. Along with that, better education to younger females about family planning and treating having kids and sex with more significance. This in turn leads to less children and the avoidance of overpopulation helping the climate crisis. These points hit in the reading allow us to realize that the climate crisis can be fixed in various ways that can even be unseen or thought of initially by humans. But, taking note and paying attention to the little things can take us a very long way in the changing of how we live and treat planet Earth.

I think the point that is most interesting among the ones listed in the reading is the idea of only having children when planned, because of how disheartening it is that it is still being fought over in the modern day. Having easier access to contraceptives and sexual education is such an obvious benefit to humanity because it promotes knowledge about our bodies and its natural processes, leaves fewer children displaced in orphanages when they are not wanted, and reduces population and number of abortions. Yet the people fighting back against these measures do so based on...what exactly? Religious reasons? Moral grounds? It is frustrating that people are left having unwanted children because their access to these resources are restricted, and in doing so, the carbon footprint of humanity as a whole goes up when it could have been averted with better policymakers. The entire issue is quite illogical because this is something that should have been solved a long time ago, and yet it continues to be fought over in the modern day.

In my personal perspective, I think that this is probably my favorite article in this quarter. This is not because the reading assignment is short, but by the point this article provides specific and applicable solutions and methods for us to do in our daily life. Moreover, since this article is expressed so crystal clear, I would recommend my parents and my friends to read it as well. One example from the article is the cultivation of rice. Since I am from China, and I already heard that Chinese scientists have discovered a new technology to hybrid rice, which and greatly solve the food problems in worldwide. However, what is more surprisingly to me is that now we have developed a new kind of rice which can reduce carbon emission during the cultivation. I never thought that there would be a kind of rice would have the property of different water loving level and by using the nutrition to rice differently can change the methane emission level. But these are not the most important part, what’s matter the most is that we need to waste less food, and consume less meat in our life, because these things can greatly reduce carbon emission.

This was also my favorite article we read this quarter. It was nice to have an article that had solutions and wasn't full of all the consequences of climate change. This article explained all of the solutions well and there wasn't anything that I didn't understand. I sent this article to my family since I always tell them about the dangers of climate change and never provide any solutions. I feel like some of the solutions are easy to take care of. For example, I think we could start educating women now. They need to know about safe sex and have access to birth control. I also feel like it wouldn't be that hard to get people to start leaning towards a plant-based diet. I know that, especially in America, people love hamburgers and steaks, but I think that if we explained just how much damage the meat industry caused then maybe people would switch over. There were also a few solutions that surprised me. I had no idea that refrigerators were such a problem.


<br><hr>


I agree with you! This article is a good source for not only people in this class but also everyone to read because it's so organized and detailed. It's very readable and full of new information. It talked about many new fields and perspectives that didn't really get covered in. the past which just attracted me a lot. This article is eye-opening and appealing for me; it gave me the confidence that we can actually put every single plan in this article into action, which is very exciting.



<br><hr>

I agree too! I found this reading to be different than the other readings in such that instead of talking about the existence of climate change or the damage that we are causing to the Earth, this reading offers easy solutions that can mitigate the climate crisis. The fact that this article was easy to read makes it so that it is more accessible; if I were to be honest, the other readings we did were a lot more complex than this. My parents are interested in how to be more globally aware, however if I sent them the readings of the previous week, they would not be able to understand/comprehend them. This reading however, not only is easy to understand, but provides everyday solutions that my parents can apply to their daily life in order to be environmentally friendly. For me, an interesting example was the first one, which was refrigerator management. I did not know that refrigerators were a big problem, and it was interesting to see why. Most of the top solutions are those that we have discussed in the lectures, like reduced food waste, and plant rich diet. We should all try these solutions in order to fight against climate change.

Reading the list of top effective ways to reduce carbon emissions was really interesting and different from anything I've really read. For instance, I'm definitely aware that women in certain parts of the world are mistreated and unable to gain any sort of proper edication, but it was interesting to see another downside of this where because of improper education and lack of contraceptives they end up with too many children. This ultimately leads to the world's population increasing. I'm also aware that the worlds topical forests are suffering as a result of the climate change, and just last year the amazon was on fire destroying not only a large portion of the forest, but the animals that live in it as well. The fact that tropical forests also used to take up 12 percent of the world's landmass and now have been reduced to only 5 percent is astonishing and honestly heartbreaking. If so much of the tropical forest is able to be reduced to such a small portion of time should be eye opening to those who don't believe in climate change, or who thing it isn't human caused. My only hope is for the world to start consciously taking the necessary actions to stop what is happening.

I enjoyed reading Project Drawdowns Summary of Solutions. It was very informing to an individual who would like to know what people need to as a whole to reduce our emission of greenhouse gases. When looking at a breakdown of an individual’s carbon footprint it can be summarized in three main areas, transportation, housing, and food production. But when we address this issue globally not personally there are a lot more solutions to consider. Besides the top 3 on the list I was not even aware of the other solutions. I think there needs to be more information put out educating the population on these solutions, the only way to battle ignorance is through wisdom.

I agree with you. This reading assignment is the first one that makes me feel optimistic and happy along all other materials that Ken gave us because it offers clear and direct solutions that can address the climate crisis. I’m glad that Ken finally starts to show some practical ways to reduce the emission. Before reading the information in Project Drawdown, I was very pessimistic about the our future because of all the catastrophic consequences that Ken shows us. When I read the solutions in Project Drawdown, I begin to regain hope. It serves as a roadmap to a brighter future and, most important, it gives us reliable and practical ways to implement our actions. I believe that many people are willing to change in order to solve the climate crisis but they just don’t know how. Project Drawdown shows us lots of ways that we can change and improve. 
                     <br><br>

It also broaden my horizons. I am surprised when I find out that how much emission can be reduced if we increase the education on girls. Just like you said, I did not know that there are many different aspects in our society that can affect global emission. My family has already put solar panels on our rooftop and begin to reduce the consumption on meet. If all of us can do and change, even a little, what the Project Drawdown proposes, it will bring significant improvement in the environment.

Project drawdown enumerates an abundance of actions that can be taken to not only reduce global greenhouse emissions but to also help sequester the emissions already present in our atmosphere. With a variety of options ranging from altering our food habits, to reevaluating our energy sources, to making education more available to women, to considering our land use, the article makes the salvation of our environment seem within reach during this decade. Admittedly, I had learned about many of these options in my high school AP Environmental Sciences class, but the convenience of this article makes understanding the true benefit of these steps just that much easier. Although, most of the actions talked about aren’t really steps that an individual can take to help reduce their carbon footprint. Most of the things listed require either governmental implementation or corporate willingness to change protocols. The mention of switching to renewable energy sources such as wind, geothermal, or solar, is an action that the public doesn’t really have any power over. Implementations such as that would require companies to be willing to dedicate investments and labor into harvesting those types of power and making it something that’s a viable resource of global energy. It would also require government subsidies that would make the cost of harvesting those renewables reasonable enough compared to the cheapness and convenience of fossil fuels. The only hand that the public could really play in this process is by voting for government officials that would support a transition to greater use of renewable energy resources. This really takes power away from the public and places it into the hands of the top percent, which are usually money-driven and consequently careless for our environment. This provides me with absolutely no comfort.

Some things mentioned in the article, such as reducing food waste, switching to plant-rich diets, educating more women and girls, and using clean cookstoves are things that and individual can directly take part in. With food production being the second-largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions, the impact that wasting less food and eating no meat or very little meat could have is enormous. Knowing that emissions could be reduced by 63% if more people took part in establishing a vegetarian diet is extremely compelling and makes me deeply consider going vegetarian. But the idea that a good portion of the global population would be willing to switch to a vegetarian diet seems highly unreasonable. From personal experience, I have asked my dad multiple times if he’d be willing to go vegetarian and every time I pose the question, he laughs and replies with the same answer, “I like chicken too much for that.” And this is coming from a man who refuses to buy anything wrapped in plastic packaging. Even with a progressive mindset, he refuses to give up what he would describe as the luxury of eating meat. Thus I feel that convincing those who might care less about the environment and the role their playing in climate change to alter their diets is like asking to be rejected. This all stems back to the foundational cause of anthropogenic climate change which is the ensuing human habits and culture that propel waste and the pollution of our environment. I don’t see a lasting solution to the climate crisis that doesn’t involve a fundamental change to the culture that’s currently established.

I was surprised when I learned that the most effective way to cut down CO2 emissions is refrigerant management. I would have thought that the number one solutions would have been managing our diet, cutting down on our use of planes and vehicles, or to switch to solar or wind energy. I never would’ve considered managing the chemicals in my refrigerator as a main contributor to the climate crisis. I was confused at first, but I learned that 90% of emissions from refrigerators happen at the end of its lifetime. This makes a lot of sense because the chemicals are released into the atmosphere and environment when the refrigerator is being disposed of. The statistic that states refrigerant management could reduce global CO2 emissions by 89.74 gigatons by 2050 is astonishing. With this knowledge in mind, I will definitely consider refrigerators with natural refrigerants when I purchase my own in the future. 
                      <br><br>
Overall, I found the “Summary of Solutions” as an engaging and insightful reading. Every single solution offered in the first top twenty-five solutions were unique and thought-provoking. The impacts listed on side of each solution provided eye-opening statistics on how much CO2 could be reduced and how much profits could be acquired if companies and people shifted towards these solutions. As Ken pointed out, 11/25 solutions are related to land use and food. This just shows how important it is for us to monitor and regulate what we are consuming and how our food is getting on to our plates. Restorative, regenerative, and conservation agriculture are the three most important ways farmers should shift to reduce CO2 emissions. I was not surprised when I found out that switching to a plant-based diet and reducing our food waste is ranked at no.3 and 4. Ever since taking this class, I have been trying to manage my food waste and intake in the dining commons. Making sure I only take the amount that I can eat and trying to eat less meat has been my priority. Most of the solutions, however, are not things that I can do personally right now. I cannot switch to wind power, solar power, or nuclear power when I am currently living on campus. I also cannot implement agricultural practices or improve my rice cultivation methods. It is a little frustrating knowing that it is up to the people in power and control of our energy and agricultural industries. Another point that I agree with Ken is the need to prioritize education and the education of women. Especially in Third World countries, we should not be restricting education to anyone. Education is power because it gives us the knowledge to act. I agree that “education for women and girls” and “planned parenthood” is not an excuse that men can use to put the burden of the climate crisis on women. Instead, it should be a call for equal opportunities in education and providing women with the freedom to choose when she wants to have a child.

The beginning of Ken’s lecture was quite redundant. We have been putting emphasis on different modes of transportation and what contributes to the most greenhouse gas emissions for the past two weeks, as well as materialism and alternate diets. However, as I read through the Project Drawdown, I was surprised by a number of solutions humans can take on. 
                     <br><br>

I, too, was shocked that refrigerant management was the most ideal towards reducing our carbon footprint. When I think of greenhouse gas emission, my refrigerator honestly does not even cross my mind. Knowing that there are steps being taken such as the Kilagi Accord to prevent excess warming from occurring gives me hope for our future. 
                     <br><br>

Decreasing land use is of utter importance as well, but in an age of extensive technology and innovation, it is difficult for this type of change to be enacted. To keep up with this fast-paced world, money is the majority of the world’s top priority, especially when it comes to production and consumption. Humans use resources from the tropical forest for things such as industrial development and fuelwood collection, all such things being detrimental to the environment. With this, limiting land use will be a challenging task, considering the vast effort humans have put into deforestation, and the statistics that only 5% of the world’s landmass consist of tropical forests.

I really like the idea of silvopasture. Livestock can thrive in a natural environment and roam free, while also reducing CO2 emissions. Although silvopasture goes against farming norms, the benefits outweigh the cons. The falls under the central importance that trees are extremely necessary for the environment to balance the greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. This is why there must be a grand effort to reduce planned deforestation and focus on afforestation as well.

I agree that it was quite shocking to find out the amount of CO2 that just refrigerators release. I never would’ve assumed that they would have been one of the top things that generate most of the CO2 in the atmosphere. The fact that switching to propane and ammonium replacements could cause global warming to reduce by 1 degree is insane. The things you never think about are the ones that have the biggest impact on our environment. Also, food waste goes with our need for refrigerators. The amount of food that sits and rots in our fridges is unimaginable. We buy food because we think we can keep it in the fridge as long as we want but months pass and we forget about it until it’s spoiled. This results in us just throwing away the food and buying more of the same item for the process to just be repeated. Instead of doing this, we should only buy the food we know we will eat instead of letting it go to waste.

                      <br><br>

Also, in regards to “providing women with the freedom to choose when she wants to have a child,” is largely a political debate. Many of the people who choose to restrain women from having a choice over their bodies are also the ones who don’t believe in climate change. As we’ve seen, it’s already difficult to change their minds about the effects of climate change but also changing their minds about giving women the right to choose what’s right for their body seems almost impossible to do. People are so stubborn that it makes me fear that we may never be able to save our world.

You are totally right. Solar energy, wind energy, etc. are not the methods that we can do now. Focusing on wasting less food and changing to a plant-based diet really impose positive effects on reducing carbon emissions. 
                      <br><br>
In my opinion, as a developed country, the United States has made continuous progress in educating women. With the development of society, the status of women has become higher and higher. And many surveys show that American women no longer see kids as necessities. The real difficulty is that those developing countries, countries even worse than developing countries, cannot popularize education for women. Their women's status is quite low, and they are even regarded as a tool for family succession, which increases the population of their countries. As a result, poor countries have more and more uneducated women. Whether education can be popularized to backward countries has a great impact on global carbon emissions.
                      <br><br>
This book is worth reading. It proposes many ways to reduce carbon emissions, which reflects the author's efforts. The author not only uses a few simple paragraphs to express the method precisely, but also makes the impact part quite straightforward by stating the predicted data in 2050, which allows readers to understand the importance of each strategy.

Just like you, I was surprised to find out that the number one solution for climate change is refrigerant management. I actually never heard about this before this reading because I never thought deeply enough about how the refrigerator releases chemicals that affect the ozone layer. Originally when I read the title of the reading, I was thinking about how to save energy with the refrigerator because in order to save energy, we shouldn’t plug it in but then we also need it since our food will go bad in less than a couple hours. After reading the paragraphs, I understood how the refrigerant, that absorbs and releases heat affects the carbon emission since it has the ability to warm up the atmosphere by at least 1,000-9,000 times. I was surprised how much it would warm up the atmosphere because I didn’t think of it as a big issue. I do like that they already have an alternative solution such as natural refrigerants and how refrigerants can be purified for other uses. 

                      <br><br>

After reading the top 25 solutions to reduce carbon emission, I was impressed by how many solutions there are and how many are regarding food issues. When Ken said that the top 3 solution was more effective than the rest combined, it opened my eyes to how straightforward it is to reduce carbon emission and in order to reduce it, we really have to have the determination to follow these solutions.

I agree with you, Jay. I would never have expected that refrigerant management was one of the most effective ways to reduce carbon footprint. It is crazy that just by managing refrigerant we could reduce CO2 emissions by 89.74 tons by 2050. As of right now, living in IV, I can not do much about my fridge. Even if I write to my management about them purchasing more environmentally friendly fridges, I know that they will barely bat an eyelash, especially when they won’t even do anything about the other poor living conditions in their apartment. However, like you Jay, in the future I will most definitely want to buy a refrigerator with natural refrigerants. 
                      <br><br>

When I first opened the readings, I groaned since it was 25 different pages, but I found the readers to be easier and shorter to read than expected. I found all 25 solutions to be very helpful and interesting. It was interesting how 11/25 solutions relates to land use and food. It is really important for us to cut down on what we eat. Props to you for being more mindful after taking this class. Yeah, I agree with you on how men can not put the burden of the climate crisis on women. Everyone must act.

I was also very surprised to learn that refrigeration and cooling is the top thing we can change to help lower carbon emissions. There is such a focus on cars, diet, and energy use that I found it very unexpected that chemicals in the refrigerator caused so much damage to the earth. I like this list because it listed some pretty new ways that we could change our lifestyles to lower our carbon emissions. There were many things I hadn’t considered would help our environment, such as educating women and family planning. I had originally thought of such ideas to be unrelated to climate change, but through this article, I learned that they actually have quite the impact on the earth. There were also many innovative ideas I had never heard of, such as silvopasture. This made the article very refreshing, for while we were still learning about ways we could change our lifestyle to help lower carbon emissions, there were also many new ideas that I think many people would not have thought of or known about. 
                       <br><br>
I also agree with your point about not being able to do a good amount of the things listed on the list. Many of the things on the list are things that I cannot achieve or change. Solar panels and wind energy on campus, like you mentioned, are decisions made by the campus while we live on campus. The different agricultural practices are also things that are not things we can control, they are decisions made by the farmers who plant our food. However, despite the many things we cannot do that are on this list, I believe we should focus on the things that we can do, such as making tweaks to our diet and eliminating food waste. These two items were very high on the list and are also the most attainable for most people. I believe if enough people tried their best to achieve these, we could still make a large impact on the earth.

I agree with you Jay. It too thought that these solutions were thought provoking and somewhat surprising. I never thought that refrigerants were that bad for the environment and I’m surprised that in this class Ken hasn’t brought up this type of pollution. I also agree that we need to support women and make lifestyle changes when it comes to eating habits for these are the only solutions I can actually make a contribution to. I’m not a farmer and all of the solutions including: silvopasture, afforestation, conservation agriculture and tree intercropping I can’t actually do. The changes in energy and efforts to stop deforestation I can help by voting and also buying products that don’t support these policies. I also liked this article because it gave me hope for the future, seeing that we can do it; we just need to fight and try.

I was also very shocked to find out that the top item on the list for reducing CO2 is refrigerant management. To me this never would have even crossed my mind if someone would have asked me what most are impart things for reducing our footprint. Similar to what you said the first things that come to my mind is eliminating food waste, eliminating abundant car use, limiting air travel. Being so unaware that refrigerators have a huge effect on our planet made me think about what else has such a large affect that I am unaware or oblivious of. It also made me think that we just need to continue to educate people about climate change and bring up facts such refrigerant management could reduce CO2 emissions by 89.7 gigatons, I think that would be a huge eye opener. 
                           <br><br>
     As you said there is a large range or items in the tope 25 list that most of us personally cannot take part in, we do not have the means to switch to wind power, or solar power, or change the way that we grow rice. However, we can do a heck of a lot. For example, we might not be able to use solar panels, but we can cut down on out electricity and reach out to people who have more authority to voice that we want renewable energy being used in the library for electricity. Or reach out to the government and tell they we want to pass a law-making renewable energy a necessity in public places. Similarly, with food systems and consumption we can have a large impact by personally making a change. For example switching to a plant based diet, and reducing food waste, but even up and beyond that we can reach out to grocery stores asking what they do with their old food, and find ways to make used of food that has spoiled so it doesn’t go straight into the land fill where It will not be able to effectively decomposed because it is wrapped in a plastic coating. 
                          <br><br>
      As you touched upon, I think that prioritizing education can have major impacts. Knowledge is power, but especially when acted upon. If we are able to teach people not only about birth control, but about the environmental crisis I think drastic positive results could be made. Something that really stood out to me in the video was how ken stated that it was not just women who needed to be educated in contraceptives. It is advertised and portrayed so commonly that it is the women that need to be educated, but in reality, it is both men and women. They both contribute to population growth.

I completely agree with you Jay. After reading all the solutions proposed by Project Drawdown, I was shocked to see that refrigerant management was such dire issue. Especially because fridges are such common features in homes. I was surprised to learn how CFCs and HCFs depleted the ozone, but relieved to read about the Montreal protocol and Kigali Accord the phase HCFs out. The other solutions were also quite interesting. A lot of the solutions had to do with food management, because that industry produces the second largest amount of CO2 emissions. Learning about environmental Injustice and reading about the statistic that 1/3 of all food does not make it from farm or factory to fork was upsetting. There are so many factory workers who only make 3$ a day, live in horrific conditions, and can not afford food for for their family. Combined with food waste, the crisis is worsened even more. I would love to see if there is a way to reduce the waste of food by supplying food to those who cannot afford it.
                          <br><br>

Furthermore, I was excited to read that it's possible to revive old, deforested regions as well as ravaged farmlands. This is super motivating because of all the great environmental effects it would have. For example, with regenerative agriculture, nutrient uptake would improve, water retention would increase, and plants would be more pest resistant. Likewise, restored forests could be beneficial for the water cycle, conserving soil, and protecting the habitat and well being of species. Up until this point, I felt a little hopeless about halting climate change, but this article made me feel  much better. I think that sharing the Project Drawdown outline would be beneficial in teaching people the main causes of climate change and the Clear cut solutions. Some solutions are things I can not physically do myself, but by participating in elections and supporting the right people, others can work on these things. Some of the solutions that I can take part in are eating a plant based diet and using solar energy. Adopting these behaviors in my life could reduce my carbon footprint and also inspire the people around me to do the same.

I totally agree with you. It is happy to say that there are already so many approachable solutions to deal with the climate crisis. One thing I does not expect is that the refrigerant management is actually the top one thing that emits the most part of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. I do hear from the news or media report how much amount of pollution the refrigerant has been emitted to the planet, but it is really surprised that this is the top one problem. After knowing this fact, a refrigerator with less consumption of refrigerant will be an important factor for me to consider whether I should buy it or not.
                           <br><br>

Apart from refrigerant management, this reading provides 80 ways to reduce the emission of greenhouse gas. I would agree that most of this solutions are doable, and it’s not only beneficial for the environment, but sometimes saving a lot of cost for us. When browsing through the sector of these solutions, I figure out that materials, food, land use, and electricity generation have made up most of the readings, which implies that a large amount of emission is generated by the fields. Fortunately, there have been someone like the author who figures out the origin of climate change and lists practical and effective solutions for it. This reading gives me a lot of confidence in dealing with climate crisis.

Hi Jay thank you for sharing and I completely agree with your comment! I had the exact same reaction when I read that refrigerant management would be the first thing in the list of tasks we need to accomplish in order to mitigate climate change. It never occurred to me that the stuff in our fridges keeping our food cold and fresh would be the number one threat to the environment, though I knew previously that they have some negative impacts on the environment, I would have never guessed that we should regulate and target them first in order to save our environment. Out of the list of 25 potential solutions we need to employ to alleviate the climate crisis, I think that switching to a largely plant-based diet is something everyone can do and within the range of our capabilities as students specifically as it does not require extensive efforts or knowledge comparing to refrigerant management. I think switching to a largely plant-based diet should be the primary goal for us students taking this course if we want to contribute to the global efforts of saving our planet because it is an easy yet extremely effective solution to the climate crisis. Another issue related to food production is the prevalent phenomenon of wasting the food we have. Even in the dining commons, I have noticed that it is super common to see people busing plates with a lot of leftover food, and it just shocked me to see how casual the habit of wasting food in our culture and how frequent people toss food away for various reasons. In order to address this problem of wasting food, raising public awareness on the consequences of such actions is necessary because only when people realize the negative impacts of their habits on the planet will they start reconsidering their food choices and eating habits, hence reducing the amount of food they waste.

I am on the same page as you regarding refrigerants emitting so much CO2. I never would have thought my refrigerator is environmentally unfriendly at all. Before taking this class as well as English 22, cars were the sole climate enemy I had in mind. I was taught otherwise and although I consider my self to have grown environmentally conscious, I had no idea idea how my life changes would make any difference. Project Drawdown dump trucked tons of numbers and statistics into our faces that provide a sense of relief. If only a larger audience were attracted to their significance, their purpose in explaining the impact our actions have on the climate would be taken seriously. I also completely agree with the need to educate more women and girls. Although the common reasoning is that they will "have less children", educating women is more significant than that. I believe women are much brighter than some male political leaders and will take global issues more seriously. The need to educate women and girls shouldn't solely be so they won't be contributing to overpopulation, but to put more enlightened female minds in positions of power. This will result in faster action on humanitarian crises such as climate change.

While I too was surprised to learn that the most effective way to cut down CO2 emissions is refrigerant management, another solution which surprised me was the section dedicated to Peat-lands. I knew that burning peat as fuel emitted a severely dangerous amount of CO2 into the atmosphere, yet I was a bit shocked to learn that peat is only second to oceans in terms of the amount of carbon it stores, two times the amount held by all forestland on earth. While it's slightly comforting that 85% of the world's peat-lands are still intact, this fact is honestly a bit frightening as well, as if large corporations begin to tap into peat-lands as another fuel source, the amount of carbon we would be releasing is almost incomprehensible. 
                          <br><br>
I also agree that education for women and girls as well as planned parenthood not only are extremely effective solutions, but are simply extremely necessary as well, as the ability to make choices regarding one's own body should be a global unalienable right, as well as receiving equal educational opportunities. Overall I do think this reading presented many extremely obtainable solutions, and therefore provided a nice contrast to readings and films in the past which focused on the destruction caused by climate change rather than what we can actually do to take charge and create change.




<br><hr>
I agree with what you have said because I also have never thought about how refrigerant management is actually the number one solution to the problem of greenhouse gas emission. That is true because it is some chemical based stuff and of course will bring huge harm to our environment. 

                          <br><br>

However, we have focus a lot on the aspects that we encounter more in life and use the most, for example, transportation and generation of energy or food/products,etc, so we easily ignore the aspect that also causes huge emission problems. And this reading reveals the facts so now more people who read this would know some areas like the production and use of refrigerant will also cause climate crisis problems .

                          <br><br>

As Ken has mentioned in the previous video,  knowledge is important but it would only become power when we act it out, And everyone should have the opportunity to receive education because they would know more about our world and know how to make our world become a sustainable one. It is something that shouldn't be based on gender or race , social class, but is the responsibility of all of us.

I agree that refrigeration management definitely shocked me as the top way to cut down our carbon footprint. It something that is really overlooked when you really think about it, it is a big problem. I'll be honest I don't know how to properly dispose of a refrigerator. Unfortunately like you said 90% of the emissions come from the end of a fridge's life. On another note, you mentioned how important educating women was. I myself am pro-choice and believe women have the right to choose what to do with their bodies. I personally never would have thought that the climate crisis would be an argument for educating women on their options to avoid unwanted pregnancies. I agree that planned parenthood and other resources should be used wisely and not taken advantage of. We need to be able to work together.

I agree with you as I was also surprised to see refrigerant management at the top of the list but after reading that 90% of refrigerant emissions happen at the end of life so we have to dispose of them correctly it made sense since they release a lot of harsh chemicals. The impact part of this section mentions that over 30 years containing 87% of refrigerants likely to be released could avoid emissions equivalent to 98.7 gigatons of CO2. This is a huge number!! Luckily people are taking action by making agreements such as the Kigali accord to make a change in the refrigerants used so hopefully this goal is reached by 2050. 
                          <br><br>

I found this reading to be very interesting since different variables were numbered from most impactful to least. Ken mentioned that 11/25 of the solutions mentioned were food and land related and I found it interesting and thought provoking to read the different kinds of solutions offered. I was not surprised to see 35% of food in high-income economies is thrown out by consumers while people in low-income economies throw out very little to no food. This made me remember working at the dinning commons on campus where at the end of the day when we closed we threw away most of the food. This was during my freshman year and when doing this I would feel so guilty and would also remember how during orientation I was told that UCSB was one the "greenest" UC campus.

I agree with so much of what you say. It was completely surprising to me to find that refrigerating and cutting it down and managing it was the best way to cut CO2 emissions. One would think it would be cars or energy production that would need the most work to get the CO2 levels down for our planet. I thought that the reading was very insightful as well  because of all the possible solutions that were given in it and how they could be applied to our lives so easily in some areas. We need to cut back on the land we use to produce food because the less amount of land we have producing excess emissions, the better the chance we have to deal with climate change. We also need to deal with our food waste, since Ken told us that 40% of food goes to waste in the United States which is not a viable thing to have at any point in time for our planet. To combat greenhouse gases, deforestation needs to be combated in more hard because of how useful trees are for regulating the atmosphere. The biggest take I got from everything was the topic of education, especially for women. With reductions in the rates of birth by having women more educated about their bodies and giving them more control will definitely help the battle against climate change. If countries are truly serious about saving our planet, we need to be willing to help other countries who are more poor to learn how to battle climate change.

In response, I was also surprised that the number one way to decrease our emissions of CO2 is refrigerant management. I am shocked that we haven't learned about this as much as other problems such as transportation, diet and consumption. I really didn't even know that chemicals in a fridge being a contributor of CO2 or that it was a thing at all. A lot of the chemicals being released into the atmosphere is during the disposal of refrigerators. I think two of the most important impacts are educating girls and plant-based diet. Women with more years of education have fewer and healthier children, and actively manage their reproductive health. Educated girls get higher wages which is important in establishing a family and being able to provide food and housing for them which results in higher mortality rates for their children and then their children will be educated and the cycle will be repeated. Girls who get educated are also least likely to get married while they're young or being forced into marriage. Obviously the factor we are worried about is the huge jump in population growth. By educating young women, this will increase the likeliness of them using contraception. Eating a plant based diet is not only crucial for decreasing CO2 and methane emissions, but diabetes and other health measures are such a problem in the United States and this is the best way to help. Obviously for this to work, a plant based diet has to be affordable and enticing. We have to educate people on why it is so important to lower our meat intake.

I agree with you, Project Drawdown does a good job at visualizing the solutions for the climate crisis, while also revealing the possible outcomes and the approximate tons of greenhouse emissions that can be avoided. Reducing food waste and switching to a plant-based diet would be 10x better to the planet than driving an electric car, as we have learned electric cars are not that sustainable as we used to believe. In addition, education towards women, which is associated with family planning, will have a huge impact on our carbon footprint avoiding 103 Gigatons of greenhouse gases. Like you said, education is power, thus it gives us the tools to "act upon knowledge" and for instance, learning about the climate crisis has led me to consider switching to a plant-based diet, to definitely reduce my food waste, and be mindful of how my actions and choices affect our planet.

I totally agree with you on how shocking it is to know that refrigerant management is the NO.1 effective way to cut down CO2 emission. However, after thinking deeply, I realized that people do overuse refrigerators in our daily life. It probably is not obvious if you are living in an apartment, which is one of the way to cut down CO2 emission as Ken mentioned several lectures ago, but if most people I know who live in houses would keep at least two refrigerators at their houses. One of those people I knew even have four refrigerators at her house, and she separated meat, vegetables, drinks, and fruits in different ones, and obviously when she introduced it, she was pretty proud of it. I never related this to climate crisis before, but if people started by cutting down refrigerators usage before the environmental-friendly refrigerant is invited, absolutely there will be a huge difference. 
                          <br><br>

Also, food wasting definitely is one of the largest climate crisis issue on college campus, as all of the dinning commons are buffet, and students inevitably take more than they can consume. I rarely see one single people finishing everything they take and usually put the dishes aside if they taste it and does not like them. 
                          <br><br>

The 25 solutions are effective and it also will benefit the society. For example women education, as the article introduces, educating more women will lead to less birth-rate, less family burden, and raise women's position in household and all over the world, especially in less developed country. It totally worth shot.

I was also pretty surprised by the fact that the #1 most effective way to cut down C02 emissions was to change the way our refrigerators work. You would think that with all the talk about the climate change that this method to cut down C02 would be more well known. In addition to being surprised by this, I was also surprised that the top  #3 and #4 ways to cut down C02 lied simply in the way we eat. This shows that we can actually make a big difference if enough people got on board. It isn't just up to the companies who are cutting down trees and companies who are emitting C02. It's up to us as well. 

                          <br><br>

If you add up all of the Project Drawdown solutions that involve the food industry or land emissions from the food industry, you will quickly see that the way we eat is a significant contributor to the C02 emissions in the atmosphere. In addition to this, a significant portion of C02 emissions involves the WAY that we farm. If we simply changed farming methods that would reduce profit for possibly a few seasons, C02 emissions would drop and in addition to this the land will be much more fertile and rich, which would actually increase profit for farmers long term. It's a win-win.

I was also astonished to hear that refrigerant management was the number one way we could help CO2 emissions. I think it’s surprising because obviously most of us would’ve assumed something else such as a plant based diet or alternative fuel sources would have a greater positive effect than just our refrigerators and AC but we would be wrong. It also shocked me that HFCs have a 1000-9000 times greater capacity to warm the planet than the older CFCs and HCFCs did. But I think this is good news in some sense because this is something most of us can personally do to help. By making sure we purchase refrigerators and air conditioning units that use more natural refrigerants we can all make a pretty big positive difference with regards to climate change. I didn’t realize that it could change as much as 89.74 gigatons of CO2 over a 30 year period if we only were more aware of what type of units we purchase. It just seems like such a staggering amount to help with, but as I said, I think it’s a good thing that something so small can make such a positive change for our planet.





<br><hr>


I like how Project Drawdown's suggestions are well-organized and thoroughly explained. I agree with you in the sense that this was my most significant takeaway from reading the Summary of Solutions - indeed, refrigerant management is an important global issue. Every household probably has a fridge to keep things fresh, and every country in a warm climate would employ a wide usage of air conditioning, sometimes even 24/7 (e.g. in parts of Southeast Asia). Given that it's probably difficult to convince people not to use any cooling devices (and sometimes for valid health-related reasons), we must accelerate the replacement of HFCs before they contribute irreversible impacts to our rising temperatures.
                          <br><br>

On a sidenote, I've definitely reiterated the importance of reduced food waste and plant-rich diet as steps ALL OF US can take. Although the world we live in now is increasingly controlled by the powerful minority, and sometimes it is easy to feel that our habitual changes would be easily overshadowed by the big polluting corporations and climate-change-denying politicians, we should consider the combined influence of millions, even billions of people!

I agree with you on this. I am glad that this course is introducing us to solutions as young people. Refrigeration is something that I would have never thought about. Many of us do not have our own place where we have to make purchases like a fridge yet. So it is great that I am being educated about this now because I am learning to cautiously adult. These solutions are primarily rethinking and regenerating the things we already have, not creating whole new technologies like electric cars, which, as Ken pointed out, is not even on the top 25 solutions list.
                          <br><br>
While a lot of these solutions can start in our own homes such as refrigeration, diets, family planning, clean cookstoves, and more, a lot of these solutions feel a bit out of my hands. So I was thinking to myself, how do I, an 18 year-old college student, get wind turbines and solar farms to globalize? Of course voting, which is very important. But I can also share this information with people. I already wrack the brains of my friends when we sit down for lunch, so I can definitely do that with family and on social media. I don't want to be a "clicktivist" but there are so many people who think that the only way they can help the environment is to turn off lights, cut off the water when they brush their teeth, and buy an electric vehicle. It shocked me unto how refrigeration and education can impact emissions, so maybe more people need to be shocked, too.




<br><hr>

You made many good points in your comment, and I have to agree with you that many of the offered solutions were surprising. In class it seems like we have focused more on switching to plant-based diets and reducing how often we travel by car and plane. Moreover, a lot of the films and readings we looked at seemed pessimistic and made me feel hopeless about the future, but the "Summary of Solutions" was refreshing, not only because it suggested many ways we could save our planet, but also because it showed how much of an impact implementing these solutions would have, and even mentioned which ones were already in the process of becoming more popular.
                          <br><br>

I do agree with the point you made about many of these solutions not being ones that we could do personally, which is definitely frustrating as it makes us feel powerless in the fight against climate change. However, I do think that now that we are aware of the many ways we can reduce CO2 emission levels in the atmosphere, we can definitely carry out movements in support of these changes and hopefully convince people in power to make the necessary changes. Additionally, I think more people need to be aware of these solutions. We're always advocating for less plastic use, and a plant-based diet because those are the only things we know, but if more people knew about the negative impacts of refrigerants, for example, we could probably make more impactful changes.




<br><hr>

I was also shocked to find out that an effective way to cut down CO2 emissions is refrigerant management. I also thought the same when it came to solutions, not a refrigerator. Switching to natural refrigerators can reduce the temperature to 1 degree Fahrenheit. The "Summary of Solutions" introduced me to many other ways that we were emitting CO2 and how to ultimately reduce them in the future. When I first started reading the solution to education for women and girls, I was confused because I was like "how is this relevant to climate change?" But after reading it, I realized that educating women helps reduce overpopulation because women will be educated on planned parenthood and some may strive for education rather than starting a family.

I too was completely surprised to read the section regarding refrigerant management as during this course we’ve been, predominantly, talking about carbon dioxide and methane that I forgot about the impact that HFC’s have on our atmosphere. The fact that they are 1,000 to 4,000 times more detrimental to the planet than carbon dioxide makes it a very large problem; and when all it takes to fix this problem is proper disposal of a unit, it makes me furious that I wasn’t made more aware of that problem. I think it comes back to the themes presented in this week's lecture and films as well, with there needing to be systematic change in order to establish sustainable methods that will save the planet from greenhouse gas emissions. Unless people take action like the film and lecture were inspiring to do nothing is going to come to fruition. We cannot wait for others to present us with a solution. We have the solutions in front of us, all it’s going to take is people who care enough to change and care about the planet to make small adaptations to their lifestyles that will have huge benefits to the planet.




<br><hr>
I agree, Out of all the reading so far in this class, this one was the most informative. It displayed the data is a super easy to read display and got the point across to the reader. In past readings, I could myself swamped in too much writing and words that just confuse me further. 
                           <br><br>
As I went through the different ways to reduce CO2, I was very surprised to see refrigeration as the #1 way to drawback. Refrigeration is something everyone uses in America, whether they know it or not. Although I believe myself to be a turned on climate activist, I had no idea about the crisis of refrigeration. 
                           <br><br>
However, I was not surprised to see a plant based diet at #4. This has significant importance to me as I truly have sacrificed a lot in my life to help this cause. I am honestly surprised this is not #1, as there is so much that goes into eating a plant based diet. The methane from the beef industry would come to a complete halt if everyone went plant based. The vast majority of deforestation is for livestock. These two factors would greatly reduce the carbon footprint of the human race.





<br><hr>


I was also very surprised to see refrigerant management at the top of the list of ways to cut down CO2 emissions. I think the same could be said for most of the things that were at the top of the list. I really wouldn't think my refrigerator as a large source of greenhouse gas emissions. On another note, something that I appreciated about this reading was the format in which the information was organized--the choice of words in the explanations and the conciseness made it really easy to understand each of the solutions. Ken's lecture shows us that land management and food-related solutions to the climate crisis are of upmost importance. We need to spread more awareness about how important the food on our plates and how it got there is important. I think it ultimately goes back to rethinking how we communicate about the climate crisis. For many people it is still an abstract problem, something they see as too far away issue from their personal lives to take action, or to even know how to take action. So, it's important that we talk about the climate crisis in a way that's more tangible for people--and food may be one way to do so.



<br><hr>


I was also extremely surprised to see that "refrigerant management" was such a massive co2 polluter, especially since this is the first time I've heard it mentioned it at all. Seeing as I am looking to buy a refrigerator for my apartment next year I am definitely going to look into buying one with natural refrigerants.
                            <br><br>
In addition to surprising appearances on the list, I never really gave much thought to how important educating women and promoting planned parenthood would be. Initially, I was confused how women's education and planned parenthood were linked to co2 emissions, but after reading the explanations of both, it is quite clear how intrinsically tied they both are. Although they aren't directly linked to the emissions of co2, they are linked to the growth of population which in turn increases the amount of people that will then pollute the Earth in their lifetimes. A.K.A. by limiting the amount of people born, you are limiting the amount of new/potential polluters. I feel that many people hearing about expanding these programs to combat climate change may reject it out of impulse since the reasoning behind it isn't clear, but if we clearly display the chain reaction of events, then we can hit two birds with one stone by both providing an environmental good, and a societal good.



<br><hr>
I think the premise of this book is a great idea; at this point, we don’t need any more books on how bad our situation is — there is enough of them, people just need to read and watch (this class provides that). Once people understand the direction in which our climate crisis is headed, they need to know what steps are available for us to take. This way, we can focus on action and not debate. One thing, however, that I didn’t really agree with in this book and with what you and Ken are saying, was the point about educating girls to manage overpopulation. 
                            <br><br>
I don’t think that overpopulation in developing countries is a climate change threat worth focusing our energy on. As we have learned in this class, the 3 billion poorest people on the plant account for only 5% of total greenhouse gas emissions. In my poverty, inequality and social justice lecture last quarter we discussed how the "overpopulation" scare can be traced back to Malthusian theory and social darwinism. By stating we do not have enough resources for our growing population and that those living in "developing" countries need to reduce the amount of children they have implies that population is the problem. While our population may be growing, we all know that if that was our issue, the "first world" alone would not be responsible for 2/3 of all emissions. Until we really get to the bottom of living sustainably, it is unfair to place blame and pressure on the populations most affected and least responsible. That said, I do of course think girls globally need more and better sex education. I just think that it is a issue that should be separated from the myth of "overpopulation," a scare tactic to demonize the poor and the the blame off the rich.

I was also very surprised to find that the number one solution addressed in Project Drawdown was refrigerant management. I never would have considered our refrigerators to be such a great contributor to global CO2 emissions. Refrigerators are such a common household appliance that has allowed everyone, ironically, to purchase and store greater amounts of different types of food. I always considered the impact of changing to a plant-based diet, but not the actual technology we use in order to keep food in homes.
                            <br><br>
I share your frustration with many of the solutions not being things I can do personally as a college student living on campus. However, I feel as though this highlights the great responsibility that the government and those in power have been neglecting, implementing change in order to mitigate the climate crisis and move away from a profit-based motivation model. I also found the solution presented by Project Drawdown on the need for education for women to be very refreshing to read about. I feel that even though there has been a greater movement for women's rights and equality, many in third world countries have not experienced the same changes as us. They, as anyone should be, are entitled to a proper education of their options and being given the ability to make their own choices instead of being forced into a societal cycle of absence and restrictiveness. Not only is this an environmental issue, but it is also one of morality and equality. The institution in which we all find ourselves living in should work for the people, instead of controlling them. I felt that Project Drawdown demonstrated the various aspects of our everyday lives that need reconsideration for its environmental effect and the importance of changing our poor decisions in a collective effort for saving the planet.

Similarly, I thought this reading was also very surprising because of the facts that make you think so much about all the things we do without really knowing we do them. The fact that the refrigerant chemicals were the top ones was very shocking because one wouldn't really suspect that refrigerators especially causes that much harm. I also found it really upsetting that high income economies will see this type of switch of refrigerants before low income economies. Another statistic I found really upsetting was the Tropical Forest section where it tells us how much landmass tropical forests use to take up compared to nowadays. Now, tropical forests take up 5% of  our landmass compared to 12% before. I thought it was very heartbreaking obviously that as time goes on the planet dies at a higher and higher rate. What I did appreciate about this reading is the impact section because it told us how we can make it better. For the tropical forest section I stated that 751 million acres of degraded land could be restored! This reading was really good in my opinion because it wasn't difficult to understand. By this I mean it was straightforward and not too confusing with numbers and science. It provokes readers to see all the harm we are doing and offers ways to change our actions through the straight foward and insightful wording and tone.

I was surprised when refrigeration management was listed as the first effective way to cut down CO2 emissions in the Project Drawdown. As someone who doesn’t eat a plant based diet I have given it my best effort to cut down on chicken during meals and completely remove beef from my diet. While being careful what I eat and making a commitment to lower my waste I still look like the “worst eater” among my friends. It has been extremely difficult for me to not feel like an outcast during meals when I’m scolded by my peers for my choice in continuing to eat white meat. I have always found it ironic the same people that scold me for my diet fly first class to and from home and on family vacation. Since just the beginning of this class I have cut down on the amount of water and plastic I use, unplug my cords, and have reduced my food waste. This class has taught me the importance of relativity amongst lifestyle alternatives to help the environment. Any personal change is important. This week's reading has been overwhelmingly eye opening for me. I appreciate the reality that there are realistic and effective options to cut down on my carbon footprint. 
                            <br><br>

But more importantly is the sixth solution “educating girls” in the project drawdown. Empowering and educating women leads to socioeconomic growth: a greater chance of escaping poverty, having fewer and healthier children, leading healthier and more productive lives, and raising their standard of living as a whole for themselves and their families. Family planning is also a valuable tool to fight climate change. Our global population currently stands at a staggering 7.75 billion. The projected population in 2050 is 10 billion. This is a terrifying thought and on top of that we know that 45% of pregnancies are unintended. While the global population is terrifying, as stated in the article, this is not about forcing the population down. This is about the importance that we focus on the education and empowerment of women to cater to their needs, well being, and given rights. “The benefits to the planet are side effects”.

I, also, was surprised by the amount of impact that refrigerant management can have on the environment. The funny thing to me is, never in my life have I heard of this issue/solution. This is my 3rd class related to environmental science or the climate crisis and I have never heard of it. I have only heard all the common solutions like switching to a plant-based diet, implementing solar and wind, getting more fuel-efficient transportation, driving less, flying less, using less A/C, changing to more efficient lightbulbs and more. To me, this just goes to show how complex the climate crisis is and how there is always more to learn and to improve on as a society. 
                            <br><br>

Again, I also am a bit frustrated just like you. It just seems like most of the best things that we could do as a society are up to the people in power. All of the individual choices that we can make seem to be so minuscule when compared to the other solutions (except for switching to a plant-based diet and wasting less food). I alone can't make any change when it comes to geothermal, nuclear, or how companies raise their cattle and grow their food. 
                            <br><br>

Despite feeling a little frustrated, Project Drawdown was ultimately beneficial, at least for me, because it gave me an idea of what needs to be done the most.



<br><hr>
I, too, was surprised to read that refrigerant management took the top spot on Project Drawdown's site. For six weeks, Ken has ingrained within us that we must cut out meat, specifically beef, to save our environment. Even this week's film revolved around animal agriculture and the harm that comes with it. Refrigerant disposal had not even crossed my mind throughout this quarter, so this was a big shock. I think that most people don't really think about what happens to technology after we are done with it. I've witnessed so many of my friends saying they were just going to throw away their batteries in the trash can, followed by me frantically telling them that the library has a designated bin for them. I've even seen people throw away printers in the trash as well. Electronic waste is something that is not underscored enough in our communities. E-waste events are rare, and most people don't want to deal with the inconvenience of having their "junk" lying around, so a simple solution is to just toss it out. I believe that the harms of refrigerant chemicals needs to be portrayed to the public because this is not common knowledge. Almost every American home has a refrigerator, and I bet that most don't know what to do with their "old" one when they purchase a new one. Having this as the first section of Project Drawdown was definitely an eye-opener and I hope that this knowledge is shouted from the rooftops. Reading all of the ways to reduce our emissions was extremely uplifting and gave me hope, especially after a pretty negative first half of English 23.

Likewise, I was very surprised to learn that the most effective solution to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions is refrigerant management. We commonly associate food/diet, transportation, and other popularized and recognizable solutions as the most impactful -- as the receive the most publicity and attention -- while in reality that aren’t truly the most impactful and holistic options when it comes to the emissions crisis. Never had I thought that refrigerants and other cooling methods (air conditioning) have contributed the most C02 emissions., and looking at the data and information relating to the depletion of the ozone layer was shocking. It is essential but also difficult to grasp how refrigerants are used in every corner of the globe, for a ton of different purposes. It is scary to think about how much of these emissions involves the cooling and regulation of millions of buildings and homes on the planet. But what really intrigued me is the direct tie refrigerants have with the food industry. Thinking about how much food we produce, consume, store, and waste and intertwine that with the ridiculously potent emissions from refrigerants, and the outcome is alarming. On the other hand, according to the project’s estimates by 2050, significant expansion of the refrigerant solution would reduce almost 90 gigatons of C02 emissions. It was also encouraging to learn about the impact the Kigali accord will have, and I hope it sets the tone for the rest of the world in the pursuit to tackle this problem. 

                            <br><br>

All in all, I really enjoyed looking through the summary of solutions index. Each summary and description under the solution provided an intriguing and enlightening explanation that made me want to read and look up more about each topic. The display of sectors, emission amounts, finances, etc. made the list genuinely appealing and interesting to review. I think the project’s organization and distribution of this information will play a key role in how people respond and react to viewing it, and like Ken mentioned, Project Drawdown has been exemplary in building a holistic and organized approach to the very complex issue of greenhouse emissions. Lastly, in regards to population, it was very interesting to see the impact and inclusion of education for girls and women, promoting ideas of having fewer children and smarter family planning. Personally, I think population is one of the most worrisome topics; I feel like many of us think that an increase from 7.75 billion to 10 billion doesn’t seem crazy, but how can we be so relaxed if we have no idea what kind of impact the addition of 3 billion people would contribute to the problem.

I was also very surprised that limiting refrigerator use could be so beneficial in reducing CO2 emissions. I typically think about limiting car use when considering ways to reduce one's carbon footprint. However, after learning the large CO2 footprint of a refrigerator, it makes sense that this could be a key in reducing CO2 emissions. After all, most people have at least one refrigerator in their house with many families have a second refrigerator. Many people also keep mini-fridges in their homes. This high number of refrigerators being used plus their high carbon footprint is bound to have a significant impact on our CO2 emissions.



<br><hr>

I agree with you. Refrigerant Management ranked the top one really shocks me. About ten years ago, I used to hear people talking about the harm that HFCs brought to the Ozone and read science books about this. However, the topic related to refrigerant seemed to disappear when time passed by. They were replaced by other hot issues, such as fossil fuels and consumerism. Seeing this site's mention of refrigerants makes me feel both happy and sad: I am happy because this serious problem is showed to the public again by Drawdown; I am sad because we didn't publicize this issue well in the past. 
                            <br><br>
I am happy to know the Kigali accord: the world will phase out HFCs—starting with high-income countries in 2019, then some low-income countries in 2024 and others in 2028. To be honest, I am not sure whether we can achieve this goal on time. I learned about the Paris Agreement in the first half of the class. Sadly, many countries do not comply with the treaty, and it becomes meaningless. Although I am a little pessimistic, I am still willing to contribute my power. In the future, I will buy refrigerators with natural refrigerant and ask my family to do the same.

I agree there are some things as individuals that we can do yet, big impacts like switching to wind power is not something we can change quickly, or have much control over. It is frustrating to know that the older generation that does have power and influence are not prioritizing using energy that will reduce gas emissions, but only seek to profit from industries already in play.




<br><hr>

I found it really awesome to read the information provided by project drawdown, especially because they provided such a wide plethora of options that would reduce toxic gas emissions.  I too was floored to see just how staggering the numbers were, how many millions of tonnes of harmful gases are produced in the use and disposal of air conditioning units.  In a lot of places, especially the continental US, it would be feasible to change or at least reduce these practices.  However, clearly we are facing this issue because Americans have become accostumed to a perfectly regulated indoor temperature no matter the consequences.  We face a problem in this sector that we face in many others, like the automobile industry and fast fashion.  Our practices in America are obliterating the world.  But lets face it, our behavior also provides us a very cushy life style with amenities galore.  And these amenities are denied to the rest of the world, for a multitude of reasons, but mostly because information has been gathered about our practices and it is clear they are obliterating the Earth.  But is there something about Americans that makes us inherently more allowed to do selfish and destructive things? Should people suffering in blistering heat around the world be denied air conditioning just because the Americans have already surpassed the quota? Who allowed us to decide the fate of the Earth and all of the people who inhabit it? I am truly truly delighted that something as simple as adjusting air conditioning use could assist the planet in such a profound way.  However, I cannot hide my dismay that not only did we cause so much of the pain and suffering around the world, but Americans also act like we are the only ones who deserve to contribute to this carbon crisis, and that everyone else must suffer the consequences and be denied life saving, carbon emitting amenities.

Like you, I was also really surprised to learn that managing refrigerants is the most effective method of reducing CO2 emissions. I don't think I've ever heard of the impact of refrigerants on the climate, even through all of the films I've watched and articles I've read. I'm curious as to why this topic isn't as talked about, compared to, say, switching to a plant-based diet, or reducing our driving. I had heard of CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs but I didn't know that they came from refrigerants. I'll definitely consider the type of refrigerator I buy in the future after reading about it.
                            <br><br>

It also became even more clear to me that many of the practices and industries contributing the most to the climate crisis are land, agriculture, and food related. Changing our own food consumption to be more plant-based, and less wasteful, is a way that we as individuals can have an impact on mitigating climate change. Like you said, it's frustrating to have to sit back and hope that the people in control of the energy and agriculture industries change their ways. Diet, and being mindful and deliberate in what food we purchase, is a way that we can contribute to change, on the demand side of things. I find this to be empowering, and I really should be more conscious of my diet.
                            <br><br>

As for the education of women and girls, I agree that education and access to birth control needs to be more widely available, especially in lower-income, developing countries and areas. To me, it was extremely concerning to learn that 45% of pregnancies in the United States are unintended. I would have never guessed the number to be that high. It's concerning because the United States is progressive in its education for women and access to birth control. It makes me wonder why there is still so many unintended pregnancies.






<br><hr>


I agree completely, I was not expecting refrigerant management to be the top reason driving CO2 emissions. It's also shocking to know that even if we individually change our lifestyle habits, it would not be a very large impact. Most of the top solutions listed needed some type of government intervention. Therefore, to really impact the climate we must make the crisis well known and educate the public. As a start, I feel that this class being implemented at UCSB is doing a good job of educating a large audience. Through this education, we as students can teach our peers and parents how to be more environmentally conscious. Truly, the only thing that will drive these changes is to vote for someone who will implement them. After a few weeks of this class, I am glad that I decided to register to vote. Honestly, initially, I only registered because the people kept pestering me to do so. But now after learning how far my vote can go to save the climate, I will probably go out and vote for the first time.

Agree. It is for sure shocked to have refrigerant management as the top solution the Project Drawdown included. Since its invention, the refrigerator has gradually become a basic and necessary electrical appliance in each family. I’ve never thought about life without a refrigerator and had no idea it is the most pollutant and costly way for the planet. It’s easy to recognize an “energy conservation” label on each SIEMENS refrigerator, and I used to think if I put my refrigerator to the 1st tap position, I was doing an energy-saving thing, and I was trying to protect the environment. Thanks to Project Drawdown and Ken’s video, for they let me realize what we can do to truly save the planet. 

                            <br><br>

I really appreciate your action to keep yourself from wasting. When I was in junior high school, my school didn’t allow any apparent food waste. They assigned one to two people at the exit of the dining hall, and these people would stop the students who wasted a lot and ask them to finish the leftover. I was tired of that kind of management and never thought about the potential power these actions could have and the difference these efforts could make. I hope that everyone could realize the power of controlling food waste, or related authorities could take action on such an issue.

Like you, I was absolutely shocked at all these solutions we have for the climate crisis. There were some solutions that weren’t new to me. For example, I already knew that consuming a plant based diet was a good step to take if any individual wanted to help the environment. As I learned from the summary,  a meat-centric diet accounts for 1/5 of global emissions. They also tend to be healthier. I had no idea that tropical rainforests were being  damaged so badly. I would see coverage on huge forest fires now and then on the news, but they would stop after a week. Its crazy that tropical forests used to make up 12% of land mass and it has plummeted to only 5%. Think about how many resources, environments, and cultures have been lost along with the 7% that was destroyed. However, another solution linked to this is afforestation. There were also some solutions that were questionable like nuclear plants. The most interesting solutions  I read about were “Educating Girls” & “Family Planning.” According to Project Drawdown, 225 million women in lower income countries say they want the ability to choose whether or when to become pregnant but they lack access to necessary contraceptives. Also, there are 62 million girls around the world that are not able to access an education because of economic, cultural, and safety related barriers. As a female and a Latina living in the U.S., I sometimes forget how hard people before me fought for someone like me to get an education. Still, there are girls all around the world that are not given the opportunity to get an education. Reading about all these potential solutions was a bitter-sweet experience. On one hand, it makes me hopeful. On the other hand ,despite how serious the climate crisis is, many of these options aren’t being widely practiced. They aren’t being encouraged or enforced by the government. The climate crisis is going to force us to make some radical changes in our lives, especially if we wait any longer. I believe its going to bring about many lifestyle and societal changes that should have been introduced decades ago.

After listening to Ken's Lecture and reading your comment, I was also really shocked to find out that refrigerant management is the most effective way to cut down CO2 emissions. It is astonishing how things in our household can produce so much CO2 into our atmosphere. Although 90% of its emissions happen after were done using it, it is still important to well maintain them when at home. It is important to make sure you have the same fridge for as long as possible. This way, you'll be saving a lot of CO2 consumption.


<br><hr>

I completely agree, I had no idea and would have never thought of refrigerant management for reducing CO2 emissions! If I hadn't taken this class I would have never known, and in these moments I am extremely grateful that I am becoming more knowledgeable and moving away from ignorance. I definitely will look more into refrigerators and like you, look into natural refrigerants because I know for a fact I will need one in the future. 
                            <br><br>
"Summary of Solutions" was an amazing read and a great resource! I am always looking for ways to reduce my carbon footprint and this read gave me new insights on how I can do that! I like that you mentioned how you have started becoming more conscious at the dining halls because I have also been more thoughtful since taking this class! Before, I found myself taking food for the heck of it, because I can and this would often lead to uneaten food. Now, I take less because I can always get more, but I can't return what I've already taken. Education certainly should be for everyone, I think it is a right that cannot be taken from anyone, especially not women as they account for half of the human population. I am in a privileged position to be receiving higher education and I always remind myself not to take it for granted because there are so many people across the world who simply cannot get an education. Education has shaped my world view and in terms of the climate crisis, more aware of my carbon footprint. The same should be available for everyone.

Yes, I agree. It is so interesting. Like most of the top 100 ranks, the top 3 of this rank combined has more impact than the last 75 combined. Electricity, land use, food, city and building, and transport are the sectors that happen most frequently in the list. The electricity generated-solutions are expensive. Thus, before the material and technology become much cheaper, those solutions are not practical. City building is necessary and benefits the most. Food, transport, and land use are the three sectors that are practical as solutions. However, as long as the economy of developing nations grows, the result will be worse. When people become not poor anymore, the quality of food, land use, and transport becomes more important for them. Comparing with the population of developing nations, the effort of the developed nation will be useless. 
                            <br><br>


Making women more educated is a great solution. By the way, I always believe charity as education is the best way and the only way to save the poor people and make the world become better.

I felt hopeful while reading about the different ways we can reduce carbon emissions. Project Drawdown lists many effective - and surprisingly easy - ways we can change our lifestyles to reduce our carbon footprints. I was also surprised that refrigerant management topped the list; before reading this article, I had no idea that although HFCs don’t damage the ozone layer, they have 1,000 to 9,000 times greater capacity to warm the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.
                            <br><br>
One of the most important takeaways from Project Drawdown is how as consumers, we need to be conscious about what we choose to eat and how much of it we end up wasting. It’s incredible that “a third of the food raised or prepared does not make it from farm or factory to fork,” especially given how many homeless people and low-income families go hungry every day. This is something that should not be happening in higher-income countries; instead of discarding perfectly edible foods just because they have physical imperfections, we should at least donate more to food banks and provide the food that will otherwise go wasted to homeless people. Or, we could follow the examples of other countries. France, for instance, instituted a food waste law that bans grocery stores of a certain size from tossing unsold foods, and these foods are now being sold at separate grocery stores for discounted prices. Ultimately, the U.S. needs a large cultural shift to reverse our habits of being wasteful consumers.

I was also shocked to find how much CO2 admission refrigerators can contribute to. I was even more shocked to see the 25+ solutions that we can implement into our society to benefit the climate crisis. It is sos shocking to me that these solutions are not often talked about, it feels like they should be common sense, something that everyone is aware of, but I was not aware of 85% of these solutions before this class. I feel like this information should be broadcasted to a larger group of people, so we can physically understand the behaviors that are adding to the damage. Without this article I would have never thought refrigerator use is such a big polluter. I too am slowly trying to change my diet and go without using extra plastic or unnecessary purchases. I love learning and becoming aware of the way the food industry, fast fashion, and culture plays into this and feel like it is information everyone should have the right to, and information that should be voiced more strongly. Project rundown really influenced the way I will make future decisions about a home and appliances I buy, my parenting choices and methods of raising children, and the way I can help by doing my individual piece of this large task.




<br><hr>

Is it ironic I this solutions article makes me feel hopeful and optimistic? Even though there are so many things we must change and headaches from sacrifices, I find this detailed plan inspiring because I feel many people have thought out the best strategies to implement. I like the precision and thoughtfulness to compose all these plans, and I really believe we can adjust to a good amount of them or at least the top few. I agree it is very interesting that we see many commercials about switching light bulbs, but that message is not nearly as effective as refrigerator management or food conservation. For trustworthy marketing, the government or a credible source should be putting these ideas in people's heads, instead of companies trying to profit from it. Manipulation harms the environment by lag time it takes to debate the issue rather than doing something about it. All we have to do is abide by these strategies and be more selfless.




<br><hr>
I was also surprised by knowing that the number one solution for climate change is refrigerant management. I thought the reduction of consumption of cow products is gonna be the most effective way to solve the problem as Ken and many documentaries have shown us this fact many times. After reading this, I will try to turn off the refrigerator when there is nothing I have to put in in it in order to help reduce the carbon footprint.
                            <br><br>


Additionally, I thought the reduction of the utilization of geothermal should be like the top 5 most effective ways to help our globe, but it's the 18th because many countries have to burn a lot of fuels in order to provide the geothermal to their people.





<br><hr>
I’m also astonished when I learned that refrigerant management is the most efficient and applicable way to reduce emissions. I knew about how the CFCS depleting the ozone are alarming and hugely harmful, but I did not know about how all the refrigerants released into the environment contributes to global warming in a considerable influence. As Ken mentioned in the video that no press says the refrigerant as a critical issue of environment, I’m worried and upset about the fact of ignorance. Additionally, I realized that social media is such a powerful tool to raise public awareness because people tend to assume the issue like refrigerant is not that serious since no press mentions. However, this is devastating to the environment since the information is not provided to the people who may care about the situation but has not enough access to the issues of the environment. 
                            <br><br>


Besides, I enjoyed this reading, which has a well-organized ranking, costs, and solutions plan for each way to tackle the climate crisis. The discussion, results, and impact are manifest, which gives the audience a good sense of the material. It is easy to understand, and it also brings positivity to the many ways that the world can do. I found out that food involved solutions are essential to climate campaign: both personal actions and global action matter.



<br><hr>


During the lecture Ken mentions that our climate footprint is based mostly on transportation and housing then food production, however, the biggest impact for reducing the footprint would be food waste because it is more practical to do for most people.  I thought the idea of educating women and connecting it to the climate was interesting.  I personally never thought that climate change could be caused by the lack of educated women.  I think population control is good to inform women on because people are consuming more than producing.  If women have more education on how to prevent unplanned parenthood it will help with population control and thus reducing future carbon footprint emitters from being born.  Although that sounds a little controversial I think education should be equal and among other things for women.



<br><hr>

I also agree that the reading was very insightful and engaging because of the fact that it was very clear cut. Being short and very comprehensive offered a reading that was very charming and understandable. Something that set me off was the third article which mentioned food waste. Seeing that because some carrots did not meet the "standard" upset me because those carrots are still edible. Just because it did not meet the visual standard, it did not make it through. There are people all around the world suffering and starving yet in some places food is just being thrown away just because it doesn't look "right". Something that also intrigued me was how we could decrease emissions by improving how rice is cultivated. This really interested me because rice has always been a staple part of my diet because of my asian heritage. Seeing that it causes so many emissions and that we can do things to prevent this goes to show that even the things that we don't think about cause emissions. I never really thought what goes into the production and consumption of the rice industry but it shows me that there are ways that we can improve our growth of such a staple crop and gives me hope if we implement such things that we can change how much we emit.

I agree with you, when I began reading I never imagined that the refrigerator and air conditioner would be huge contributors to the climate crisis.  I thought maybe it would be something else such as airplanes as stated before, or cars, or even consumption of meat.  These things make sense for so much CO2 to be released into the atmosphere.  It took me a while but I finally was able to see how exactly refrigerators emit so much CO2 into the atmosphere.  I wondered on how they could release so much CO2, and I was able to realize after rereading the text.  In the text it mentions, "refrigerator and air conditioner contains chemical refrigerants that absorb and release heat to enable chilling 90 percent of refrigerant emissions happen at end of life."  This makes sense, it makes sense for the CO2 emission to happen at the end of its lifetime.  This is because of the disposal of the refrigerators.  Refrigerators have a lot of different chemicals in them that are released when it is disposed.  They are disposed of after they do not work, so at the end of their lifetime.  As well as wind turbines and wind energy is mentioned in the reading.   And I agree with Ken that this is not  the approach we should be taking.  It is too late to start taking these approaches.  We need to stop air travel, stop transportation through vehicles, stop the consumption of meat.  We have to eat healthier, travel through public transportation.  These are the things we should be doing in order to begin the decline of the climate crisis.

I agree with you, I was surprised as well to learn to what extent refrigerators are bad for our environment-- that is something I feel like I would not have learned in any other class. I wasn't really sure about how refrigerators worked, either, before reading this. I was unaware they had to have something called a "refrigerant," I thought they were just... cold lol. Anyway, this Project Drawdown list is a super cool resource that actually provides answers!! I think I will share this website with some of my friends who are less knowledgeable on climate change. I think it is a great way to visualize things and have information in front of you with summaries that are short and sweet and easy to understand.
                            <br><br>


As for things like educating more women and girls and family planning, that seems like a no-brainer for me! As in, I feel like we should be focusing on those things regardless of whether or not they are better for the environment. Maybe this is the way to get more people interested, though.




<br><hr>

It was surprising that the number one way to cut down emissions was refrigerant management. We had never talked about the in Ken's class, but reading this made me rethink the impacts of CO2. 
                            <br><br>

AC another refrigerant are a necessary evil. The provide life in places that wouldn't be inhabited otherwise. Having been tot he Middle East during extremely hot times in the summer, I know that life would be very difficult, almost impossible without the artificial cool. 
                            <br><br>

It's somewhat ironic, because the climate crisis has been a cause of the global temperature rise, and we are combating it with refrigerants, which contributes more to the problem.

Catch 22.
                            <br><br>

How do we solve this problem? As temperature continues to increase this artificial cooling systems will be come more and more popular (especially as the technology becomes more available in developing countires).
                            <br><br>

I will think about this the next time I walk into an air-conditioned building on a cold day or the next time I use refrigerants myself. I will try and limit my use of refrigerants and if I'm hot, stuck to using a fan, sitting in that shade, or going for a swim.

I was also surprised when I learned that the most effective way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions was refrigerant management. I never considered managing chemicals in refrigerators as a major factor in the climate crisis. I was confused at first, but I learned that 90% of the emissions produced by refrigerators are at the end of their useful life. This makes sense, because chemicals are released into the atmosphere and the environment when disposing of refrigerators. By 2050, the statistics that refrigerant management can reduce global CO2 emissions by 89.74 girding are shocking. However, when choosing a refrigerator, many people will not even consider reducing emissions in the house. What I find very interesting is that reducing food waste globally can increase the effect of switching to LED lights by 10 times. But because there is no benefit, this knowledge will not be known to the public. I agree with what you said that the society has reduced the lack of public environmental education, because doing so has no profit, and often this knowledge is not widely spread. Prior to this class, my awareness of environmental protection was only superficial. When I want to protect the earth, I don't even know what to do to be efficient. Sometimes it even has negative effects, such as: eating very environmentally friendly while driving a large displacement car.

Yes! I was also surprised that the most effective way to eliminate carbon dioxide emissions is refrigerant management. The other topics that Ken addressed in this lecture video are similar to the previous videos. Automobiles are a great invention, but it is now a gigantic problem to our planet. Even though we have electrical vehicles, they produce more greenhouse gases during manufacturing. It is very important for humans to advance the technology of car manufacture. House as the other big environmental issue emitted a lot of greenhouse gases. I agree with Ken that the micro apartment is a good idea of helping reducing the carbon dioxide gases.
                             <br><br>

It is good to know that refrigerators have a big carbon footprint, so I will keep my eyes on these appliances in the future, so I can reduce a bit of carbon dioxide emissions. Still, I think we should innovate better technology and help reduce the carbon footprint. As humans we should work together and be aware of the situation we are facing.
                             <br><br>

Lastly, I think that environmentally related education should be given during K12 and even pre-K. So kids can learn all the details and then they will apply what they learn to what they do. Eventually, generations of kids will be more environmentally friendly.

I had no idea that the biggest way to reduce our CO2 consumption was by refrigerant management either. I too would have thought that the best way to reduce our global CO2 consumption was by just reducing transportation with cars and by switching to a plant-based diet, which I was glad to see at number 4.  I enjoyed reading the top 25 summary of solutions as well. I did not realize educating girls was the 6th top method of reducing our carbon footprint but it makes sense that I am ignorant to this as it is not something I see in my daily life and take education for granted compared to other countries. Silvopasture was another solution I had never head of before, and I did not realize just rice cultivation had such an enormous impact on CO2 consumption either. I am glad to read other solutions rather than the few we have been going over again and again like clothes consumption and transportation.



<br><hr>
I too was surprised when I read that the most effective way to cut down on carbon emissions is refrigerant management. I have never heard of this before this reading. By better managing this, we could reduce up to 89.74 gigatons of CO2 by 2050 while wind turbines would only reduce up to 84.60 gigatons of CO2. It was interesting to learn how most of the emissions occur towards the end of it’s lifespan rather than when it is being used. I never really thought about how a refrigerator and air conditioning works, but now I know that there are chemicals inside which “absorb and release heat in order to enable chilling” which explains how they contribute more to the climate crisis after they have served their purpose.
                             <br><br>

This reading shared a lot of valuable information and showed us various solutions that we can start acting on right away. This being the more personal of the solutions like wasting less of the food we produce and switching out our diets to consume less meat. Other technological solutions are something we can’t do at the moment, so we have to change our lifestyles if we want to start making progress in reversing climate change.





<br><hr>


I too was surprised that refrigerant management topped the list of solutions to the climate crisis. I have previously taken the English 22 class and I am currently taking an environmental science class, and this is the first time that I've heard that refrigerator chemicals contribute massively to global warming and ozone depletion. All this time, I thought that the easiest way to cut down on emissions was to change your diet or adopt sustainable ways of transportation and living--but little did I know that a common and necessary household item could cause so much damage to our atmosphere. While I do not have any use for a refrigerator now as a student on campus, in the future when I live on my own I will definitely buy a fridge that contains natural refrigerants instead.
                             <br><br>

Regarding your stance, on women's need for education in third world countries, I agree that education should be a universal right regardless of gender, but I feel like educating them won't have much of an impact on the amount of children they have. While statistics do show that educated women have less children, I feel like correlation is not necessarily causation. If anything, the culture of their society has more of an impact on their decision to have children than their education level. In many cultures, women are pushed to have children and are seen as the "odd ones out" if they do not.



<br><hr>

I was also shocked by the amount of CO2 released by fridges and how managing them better would be the most effective way to cut down CO2 emissions. This is because they release harmful chemicals into the ozone layer.  This makes me think about all the other things I don't know about climate change and the environmental impact a lot of my daily practices have. I also didn't realize how important women's education and family planning was in regards to the environment. It's another reminder of how issues pertaining to the environment also intersect with issues with women's rights, racism, and classism. 
                             <br><br>

This is why education is so important, because if more people knew the effect their actions had on the environment, maybe they would switch to more environmentally friendly practices. This reading assignment was a lot more optimistic than other readings, as it actually provides a lot practical solutions. However, a lot of the solutions proposed, especially those within the top 25 list, aren't feasible for the average individual to enact, which can be discouraging. But, I know by decreasing my own carbon footprint I can make an enormous difference.



<br><hr>

Indeed it was very surprising that refrigerant is on the top of the drawdown list of carbon dioxide. Refrigerant, like the other 10 solutions on the list, is related to food and land use. The entire chain of food management is connected: too much are being produced, too much land misused, too much wasted, and too much stored. I did a project related to food waste when I was attending a summer session at Cornell University. I interviewed several households, restaurants, local supermarkets in Ithaca about their opinions regarding food waste, including the waste situation, how they deal with the waste, etc. I also designed an app prototype aiming to reduce the amount of food waste from the start of consumption, giving them data and essential information about the food quantity they actually need, expiration dates, and where they can send the unconsumed food to, etc. Back then I knew that reducing food waste can make a huge difference in cutting down the carbon release and thus help the climate issue, but the statistics given in the reading are still overwhelming. I also learnt that reducing food waste can have a lot of positive chain effects surprisingly, for example preventing deforestation for the use of farmland. 
                             <br><br>


I think these data and summaries really help us understand the importance of each solution and get a clearer picture from the numbers that how big of a difference each of them can make. One important thing I learnt from reading these summaries was that many of them are actually interconnected, meaning that solving one issue can help improve many of the others as well. So if we set our hands on even one tiny thing that can make the problem better, a really big step is actually being made.



<br><hr>

One of the first things that I took notes on in this course was the short and sweet answer to stopping climate change: eat a plant-based diet and educate women around the world by promoting healthy family planning. Since it was one of the first things that Ken said, it really stuck with me. Now it is as if we see a new resolution each week to the biggest contributing area of our lives that will cut our CO2 emissions down. So what exactly is in the lead as far as most dangerous? What action is the average American doing that is by far the "worst" when it comes to contributing to their carbon footprint? I once believed our meat-based, and protein-dense diets were to blame. Then just last week we learned that flying in an airplane is by far the worst thing you can do to the planet, especially if it is first class. This week I'm reading that our refrigerators are to blame with their CFC's causing ozone depletion. So which is it? Which area can we cut back on that will be the most effective? 

                             <br><br>

I feel like wind turbines (onshore) are a future that we do not address enough. On the AP Environmental Science exam, I distinctly remember having to write about the pros and cons of installing a new plant full of wind turbines in the middle of the desert by a small town. Pros, of course, included a promising future in energy and a very cost-effective renewable source. Some cons included noise disturbances for the nearby town and potential danger to birds. Still, I remember the words I used to describe that the pros far outweighed the cons. I see a very promising future in wind turbines for the world. When I read all 25 Solutions by Project Drawdown, I thought I was going to be reading 25 solutions that the average American can do to help fix the issue of Climate Change. After reading up to the second solution I realized it was an overall list of things we need to do better on, not just necessarily one single, average American. Seeing the damage caused by refrigerators did not necessarily surprise me. I remember studying their effect on ozone depletion.

<br><hr>


I agree with you. I was also pretty surprised to hear that the #1 solution to reduce CO2 emissions was refrigerant management. This is mainly because I've just never heard about it before. Why do you think it isn't talked about more, given that it has one of the greatest potentials to reduce CO2 emissions? Is there some decent drawback to using alternatives that would affect our quality of life greatly? Ken said the world population would reach 10 billion in 2050. I'm curious to see how accurate this prediction is when we actually hit 2050; will we actually slow down our rate of growth? Third world countries most definitely need further education to their young women. I've heard of stories about the rampant spread of STDs in parts of Africa. Some believe that a "cure" to STDs is to have sex with a virgin, which often leads to rape. I'm not sure how much of a problem this is, but it's still indicative of the lack of education in third world countries. 
                             <br><br>

I also found it interesting that many of these solutions can still be very profitable to companies and corporations. A lot of times, climate crisis solutions seem to viewed as black and white. You either better the planet or corporations make less money which means they'll realistically not be cooperative. Profitable solutions means that we can get more people on board to putting these plans into motion.



<br><hr>

I was also surprised at reading that refrigerant management was such a large factor in greenhouse gas emissions. I remember learning about the negative effects of refrigerants in AP Environmental Science in high school but did not realize management of refrigerant would be the most effective way of cutting down emissions. I will also keep this information in mind when it comes to buying a refrigerator in the future. 
                             <br><br>
I also found “Summary of Solutions” engaging and insightful. I know I will keep these in the back of my mind going about every-day tasks. For example, in the dining commons. I like to think that I waste less food than the average student eating in the dining commons. However, I still end up wasting some food, like a hamburger bun or some rice at the bottom of the bowl. I will be more mindful of this and try to take only what I will finish eating.
                             <br><br>
Education is also an important factor. Not only will it reduce population growth through the education of women, it will also allow people to be more knowledgeable of the climate crisis. This is necessary in both saving the planet and promoting equality. There is no reason a woman should be denied the same education as a man due to their gender. They can provide as much insight and contributions to science and society, pushing for a better planet.

I agree with you about the refrigerator. I have read articles about harmful substances emitted by refrigerators, but I did not find that this problem so serious. We use refrigerators to reduce food waste, but refrigerators cause us more trouble. We can reduce the purchase and replacement of refrigerators. I also hope that new and more environmentally friendly refrigerators can be invented. Maybe we can also find another way to reduce food waste—buy less food.



<br><hr>

The refrigerator fact was also one of the more surprising facts of the film and just goes to show how there are things people can do individually that if done collectively can have a large impact on the fact. Another interesting fact was how the top 3 factors regarding actions that could be done to reduce carbon output is more significant than the bottom 75 factors. From this fact I think that it should inspire Americans that it is simple to do things that have the largest impact. Things such as starting a plant based diet or taking public transportation could easily benefit people financially as well as having less children. However, I think that the amount of children a family has is more of a personal choice than the other ones, just not eating beef and utilizing public transportation and that doing those things will already have a large impact on the world so it should be done.

I definitely agree that finding out refrigerators were the most surprising thing to see at the top of the list. Whenever I think about CO2 emissions I associate it with cars, food, agriculture, etc. but never refrigerators. I think this is also due to the idea I had that the Montreal Protocol took care of the impact refrigerators had on the climate, since it addressed CFCs. I had assumed by default that it also addressed HFCs. Another thing that was surprising to me personally was that there are natural refrigerators. I always just assumed that every refrigerator on the market was the same and just differed in its technology, such as having a touch screen or not. I definitely agree with my peers that when the time comes to me purchasing a refrigerator I will do my research on its impact and whether or not it’s a natural refrigerator. 
                             <br><br>

On another note, I definitely agree with Ken that education should be accessible to women, especially sex education. However, just how Jay Tong said, it should be an equal responsibility between men and women to be a knowledgeable about sex education.

I completely agree with you. Thanks for the reading that provides a list of solutions to improve the environment. It really makes me feel more optimistic. Also, it mentions the refrigerator’s emotion in the reading. I was surprised too. Almost every family in the world would have a refrigerator in the house to keep the food fresh. However, before reading this article, I would never think that most of the pollution happens after the refrigerator was thrown away. I can tell how important refrigerant management is in the list of tasks when I knew so much carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere. This is probably one of the easiest ways to reduce carbon dioxide efficiently but not everyone could think of that. I am glad this reading mentions it and lets more people be aware of it. So they can start this action quickly. 
                             <br><br>
On the other hand, food waste is also a very serious problem in the world. We should only buy what we need to avoid waste. The article provides twenty-five solutions that are all very helpful to the environment. We should all try our best to follow it.




<br><hr>
First off, I agree with what you said that the use of refrigeration has never really been something that I have considered to have such an impact on climate change. But then again when we look at the chemicals that a fridge has and the carbon footprint that it has when one is thrown out/built/put in use, it starts to make sense. I think that refrigeration is an absolutely necessary thing in terms of extending food life (therefore reducing food waste) and the best environmentally friendly option would just be, like you said, to consider energy and environmentally efficient refrigerators when it comes to a point in my life that i have to purchase one. Next, the reading "Summary of Solutions," was incredibly helpful because of how detailed each of the 25 solutions were. Additionally, they were comprehensive and intriguing- for example I did not know that womens education played a vital role in climate change impact.




<br><hr>

I really liked that the "Summary of Solutions" gave numbers of what everything does to contribute to climate change and the steps we can take to prevent it. It sort of makes sense that Refrigerant Management is such a big contributor because so much of the world lives in hot climates and air conditioning is widely used to cool down our houses, stores, restaurants, and almost all buildings that you can find people in. It's also not that surprising that education is so high on the list. When women are allowed to choose what they want, instead of being forced to bear children, the number of pregnancies and the amount of people the world is able to support will be lower. None of the solutions are really surprising as we have talked about them in previous videos and lectures but it's nice to have everything laid out in one website.



<br><hr>

I completely agree with your statement. I too was extremely surprised upon learning about refrigerant management and its detrimental effects. Prior to the readings/lecture, I was not familiar with this term at all and it shocks me to know now the amount of CO2 emissions released and the statistics behind it. It is only right to switch to natural refrigerators in order to reduce the emissions and our impact on the world and it calms me to know that we have cleaner alternatives available. I personally did not understand why a refrigerator would have such a big significance but now I understand its effects and consequences towards warming up the atmosphere at the end of its life. 
                             <br><br>


Personally, there is not much I can do as a student living in IV. I am subleasing from a place and so the appliances are not up to my decision. However, knowing the information that I do now, I will make sure that the next time my household or someone that I know purchases a refrigerator, that they too are educated on the options that they have. This also goes to show that many people do not know much about how big of an impact they are making just by their household alone. By educating people on the climate crisis, we will all be able to work together to slowly reduce our imprint on the planet.



<br><hr>
I feel the same way. I never think of the use of refrigerant to be one of the main cause of CO2 emission as it is the necessities of almost every families and i can't imagine how inconvenient the the life without refrigerant will be. But, after a deeper thinking when i was reading, i found this to be reasonable. As we know the chemicals released by refrigerants into the atmosphere is very harmful to the environment. And there are large amount of usage of refrigerants which make the situation worse.  After knowing this fact, i started to imagine a life without refrigerator. To my surprise, i found it to be acceptable and it's not hard. What we can do to reduce the use of refrigerator is just having a good control of the quantity of food we need while we are buying food or cooking. Try to buy food which just right for that day and leave no leftover. As for me, i will start to have a clear aware of my capacity of eating and appeal my family members and my friends to do so. It can not only reduce the use of refrigerators, but also reduce the waste of food which is also a good action of reducing carbon emission. 

                             <br><br>

Talking about the bad impact caused by consuming too much food, i am now working on the shift on my eating habit from eating much meat to eating more plant-based diet as the reading said meat production cause large amount of CO2 emission too. As a person who love eating meat and eating a lot of food, the transition is not easy but i gradually find it to be more successful and i found the benefit of having more plant-based diet. Personally, i feel more healthy and i think it's good to keep my body shape.

Project Drawdown                             <br><br>

By reviewing the ranking list of the detailed results of the Plausible Scenario, refrigerant management, wind turbines, and reduced food waste are the top three on the list that could lower down carbon emission. Especially in the YouTube video when Ken said food waste of Americans is already a severe problem that affecting green house effect. I am surprised that refrigerant management has such large impact on carbon dioxide emission and fiscal cause. The book indicates on how to slow down emissions to prevent global temperature increase but based on recent events: campfire in Australia, locust disaster in Africa etc. give me a horrifying feeling about the environment. Is that too late for us to make up to the globe after years of waste and harmful gases emission? Also, when reading the sector summary, fertility rates are tightly connected to women and girls’ education level especially in developing countries. Once women and girls receive more education, they might refuse to be treated as reproduction machines but to contribute more to the societies. This will lower down population and the potential demand for food, transportation, land etc.

I agree that it was just as surprising to me to see that “Refrigerant Management” was number one on the list. Considering how in class the solutions presented before were about diet, transportation, etc. I was sure that one of those would have came out on top. I never stopped to think about how the chemicals inside our refrigerators were and air conditioners affected the Earth. And although the ones affecting the ozone layer have been phased out, it is astonishing to know that the current ones have a “1,000 to 9,000 times greater capacity to warm the atmosphere than carbon dioxide”. The most discouraging part was when ken mentions that the top three would do more than the rest combined to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It was discouraging because I couldn’t stop thinking that if we don’t do something to chic the first three nothing will really be better even if we change the rest.

In this week’s reading, I believe the whole class found a reason to be slightly more optimistic about the future of our planet and species. I personally believe that we need to take more seriously the approaches that we must make collectively since these are the ones that will bring forth the most change in a shorter period of time. 
                              <br><br>

 
The most important aspect of this for me is to provide education for those in impoverished and precarious circumstances. By providing these people with a good education, they’ll make choices by themselves that will help save the environment, such as not having children or having fewer children, recycling, reducing their meat consumption, etc. These changes that we have to push for as a society will bring smaller changes in people’s lives that will collectively help mitigate the climate crisis.

I agree that this week's reading should give everyone a reason to be slightly more optimistic. It's always quite refreshing to see concrete plants like this, because I feel like a lot of the time everyone knows we have to do something but they don't know what exactly what that would look like. I also appreciated that some of the important items on this list were personal changes that we could make, like trying to make a transition to a plant-based diet. I also thought that education about contraception was very important, and was sad to learn that 225 million women in lower income countries wanted the ability to choose whether they wanted to be pregnant but lacked the means to do so. Education seems like such a simple solution to me, so I feel like these are very plausible solutions. The one thing that made me a little anxious about this article though was that most of these solutions seemed like they were out of my control in terms of me not being able to have a direct impact on them. It seems like these rely on institutional changes being made, and if there's anything I learnt its that we cannot rely on institutions to make these changes because they seem to have personal gains in mind over the needs of humanity. But, I still think these solutions are very important and provide optimism to those that may feel like theres no hope.


<br><Hr>
I definitely agree that this weeks reading helped me be more optimistic about the climate crisis. It is actually incredible to see how many different ways an average human can do damage to the environment without even realizing it. Even if one eats a plant based diet and doesn't drive a car, there are still so many other ways to contribute to the climate crisis by living an average lifestyle. The fact that the most effective way to reduce emissions is through refrigerant management really surprised me. You would never think that refrigerators would be that damaging to environment. What really surprised me was the fact that most of the damage is done when you throw away your refrigerator. 
                             <br><br>

The statistics provided by this article were really helpful to see how much of a change we can make as a society by just making simple lifestyle changes. A common theme that stood out to me is a high initial investment that with a very high return. Most of these proposed solutions are very costly and I think this is a heavy deterrent for many of these solutions. However, in the long run lots of money is saved after all. If the money is going to be spent anyways, why not spend less and help the environment?
                             <br><br>

 Not only will each of these changes save money in the future but they also tend to have other improvements as well. For example, increasing the intercropping of trees will not only save billions of dollars in the upcoming decades but it will also decrease erosion, create extra shade, and sequester more carbon dioxide. At this point I'm just confused about why we aren't making these changes more rapidly.

<p>
There is a type of peace that I get from this reading that seems unmatched in any other previous readings because hope is there with solutions present. We-as humans- are obviously at fault for the consequences present in the horrors we are presenting but knowing that there is a list of things that help reduce our carbon footprint ties together with Ken's points in how to help save our earth. If we go further into family planning then we reduce the population and in turn allow our carbon footprint to decrease in and of itself. However, my favorite part about this website is that there is not just things that we need to cut out but things that we can add in. I had no idea what silvopasture but realizing now that the inclusion of such to our farming would not only benefit the Earth but also the people makes me realize that there are solutions that people as a majority can get behind and not just the students of Engl 23. 
                             <br><br>
I also really value this article because of the organization of data, stating how much CO2 would be reduced, net cost and net savings along with what section the data falls under gives. For example Refrigeration Management falls under Materials and changing our emissions on that would save 89.7 in GT. This really refutes denial in preventative measures with data and statistics that allow people to know that they really do make a change in tackling the climate crisis. People typically argue that the changes they make in life do nothing but the opposite is shown and everyone person makes a difference.

Vianna, I really enjoyed your comment. I completely agree that this reading was much different then the ones we have previously read because it was not as dooms-day oriented. I feel like often we read  about so many negative aspects of climate change and how everything we do is bad, but this reading gave me hope as there were so many suggestions that we as people can do to help the crisis. I really liked how there were so many ways that we can help the environment that aren’t always talked about, in particular the idea of our refrigerators creating a huge impact was very intriguing to me as I have never heard of this concept. This reading also made me feel a bit insecure about helping the climate crisis within my own ability as some of the ways we can help are things that only large corporations have the capability to do. The fact that large corporations are a huge part of the climate crisis continues to scare me as they often are only concerned with how much money they make, and in turn I feel as though these businesses will never want to see the side of the climate crisis that is the  huge issue in order to keep revenue high. I feel like this reading also gives me hope though because many of the listed things that will alleviate climate change are within reach and I believe that the climate crisis is becoming such a large issue politically that it will hopefully continue to snowball and become a crisis that the whole world will want to help with.


<br><hr>
I understand how you felt, I also felt relief when going through the Project Drawdown articles. This reading was so much easier to digest and gave me hope for our future. The past readings left me feeling that we have already done far too much damage to the earth to turn back. These policies are optimistic and in my opinion, extremely realistic. 
                             <br><br>
Like most people, I was very surprised to see refrigerant management as the number one solution and to see it would save 89.74 gigatons. I hope Ken goes a little more in-depth about this solution because this is one I was not aware of at all. Educating more girls and family planning is one that I found very important not just for the environment but for the lives of women across the globe, especially in third world nations. This is very realistic and I hope more is done for policies like these to be implemented. It would face backlash not only from people who are anti-environmental policies but also from religious people or cultures that devalue women. I know certain religious groups refuse contraception use and shame the members into not using it which is ridiculous to me but it shows how many challenges policies like this will face.

<p>
My takeaway from Project Drawdown is that the solution to the climate crisis is not a single solution at all, but many differing steps that must be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is why the issue is so hard for many people to wrap their heads around - there aren’t one or two or ten culprits causing climate change, but hundreds, and the complexity of the issue makes it hard to educate on, and make it hard to give people a clear focus on what must be done. At the same time, a lot of misinformation about the major greenhouse gas culprits exists, complicating things further. As evidence to this, I am an environmental studies major, yet I didn’t at all expect refrigeration management to be first on Project Drawdown’s list. I was shocked to learn that HFCs have 1000 to 9000 times the capacity of CO2 to warm the atmosphere. Similarly, I was fascinated to learn that the soot and smoke caused from inefficient and rudimentary stoves is responsible for over 4 million deaths a year, and that this form of cooking contributes up to 5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions per year. 
                             <br><br>
I’m grateful that a resource like Project Drawdown exists, because a complex problem like climate change requires complex solutions, and this form of education is extremely valuable in helping everyday people and scientists alike to focus on what is most important and urgent in order to mitigate climate change’s effects.

Reading through the solutions in Project Drawdown gave me some relief that at least some people are considering some form of measurable action against the climate crisis. It's also exciting that even some of the lowest ranking solutions have the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by 1 gigaton, or 1 billion metric tons, or about 20% of the US" emissions in 2018 (5.1 billion). Still, that's quite significant. And it's exciting that there's a wider range of public policy initiatives to address the crisis than one would think. This list considers all from city planning, education, food and land use.
                             <br><br>

I think it's very interesting that the talking points of news media and influencers centers around eating less meat, reducing fueled transportation, and reducing food waste, yet these aren't the solutions that top the list. Why aren't we talking about solution #1, Refrigerant Management? I can imagine that the sheer number of HFC refrigerants across the planet makes the problem quite daunting, but if it has the potential to reduce 89.74 gigatons of C02 by 2050, it's 100% worth tackling and receiving news coverage.
                             <br><br>

I would love to study how such policy initiatives can be effectively implemented on a micro level here in Santa Barbara. Surely the addition of bike infrastructure, for example, which is #59 on the list, could have a measurable impact on Santa Barbara's emissions, especially considering the public parking problem faced by many in this county.

I have to agree that reading through the solutions was extremely relieving. After spending the last 5 weeks reading through all the evidence explaining the reality and terror of the climate crisis, I was becoming increasingly pessimistic about the future of the planet. While it still looks bad for the future of the planet, it is relieving to have a concrete list of the things everyday people can do to combat the climate crisis. It is even more relieving to know that the top rated solutions such as refrigeration management and reduced food waste can reduce CO2 emissions by a staggering 89-70 gigatons. While spreading information about the reality of the crisis is crucial, what is also crucial is telling the public how to actually confront the problem in their everyday lives. What I find is that the issue with a lot of climate change denial isn't an actual refusal of the facts, but rather a paralyzing sense of helplessness at the enormity of the issue that encourages denial. It is thus extremely helpful to have a list of things that the layman can do in their everyday lives.


<br><hr>
I had also never known that HFC refrigerants had such a large impact on CO2. Even if we are unable to pass legislation nationwide, local policy initiatives like bike infrastructure would definitely reduce the number of cars on the road. As seen from the list, there are many things we can do as individuals and in our local communities that will reduce our carbon footprints.

This was a very shocking reading, maybe the most interesting thus far. I have known some background about where emissions come from like cars, beef industry, clothing, and flying. However, a big contributor is something we all have and do not realize is a big contributor to CO2 emissions, that is refrigerators. They are an absolute necessity to living and keep our food fresh and edible. I think there is no way we can just eliminate in all because human life would be degraded immensely. However, I think we should eliminate HFCs which are destructive to our planet. We must switch to a different system that does the job and does not cause as much damage. I found this particularly interesting because I would have never thought that my refrigerator would be so bad for the planet. This issue can be solved with technology thankfully and we will not have to  make a culture change across the entire planet and regress to a hunter and gatherer system. Another waste product is of course food, which saddens me knowing that there are many kids even in our wealthy nation that do not have enough food every day. It is not okay that we waste so much food not only for the planet, but for being selfish and wasting food that some people do not have access to. Lastly, i do think it is very important to educate girls. It seems so silly that  girls are still not given education in some parts of the world, but this must be something that needs to change. Teaching girls about reproductive health and climate change can have profound effects because girls are just as able to make a change as boys. All of these contributors are not doomed to make the earth collapse, but they have the capacity to be revamped. The solutions are there. Now it is just a matter of our ability to make them happen.

I agree with you that we should find an alternative to HFCs in refrigerants. Though I’ve heard of hydrofluorocarbons before, I never followed up to learn how they affect the planet. After this reading, I learned HFCs account for only 1% of greenhouse gas emissions, but have hundreds to thousands of times the greater effect than carbon dioxide. I researched that using alternatives such as hydrocarbons instead of hydrofluorocarbons is one solution that would decrease greenhouse gas emissions and hydrocarbons are more efficient. 
                              <br><br>

Focusing on the solutions of Project Drawdown, I appreciated the layout of the rankings and the information in each category was easy to read. Though some seem repetitive, such as the many topics on forests/trees, I found waste reduction, plant rich diet, and tree intercropping the most interesting. As Ken stated, 1/3 of food does not make it to the plate. This is extremely prevalent in high income countries, where food is thrown out based on bumps, bruises, and even coloring. Food waste correlates to a plant rich diet, where the current western diet produces 1/5 of global emissions. By reducing waste and switching to a plant based diet, roughly 26.2 and 66 gigatons of carbon dioxide could be reduced by 2050, respectively. One solution I’ve never heard of is tree intercropping, which intermingles trees and crops to increase the carbon content of the soil. Project Drawdown specified four benefits: habitat for pollinators, protection for annuals, deep roots can provide nutrients for shallow roots, and light sensitive crops are protected from excess sunlight. Through this method, 17.2 gigatons of carbon dioxide could be reduced. Overall, this resource provided a comprehensive list of actions people could do without feeling overwhelmed. After reading this, reversing human’s effects on the planet seem more tangible.

I was surprised by the fact that refrigerant management, reducing food wastes and women educations can play such a significant role on helping our environment, especially for educating girls and women, but then I realized I shouldn't be.

I knew as a kid that Freon CFC-11 and CFC-12 have effects on ozone depletion, a more commonly used refrigerant nowadays HFC-134a put more carbon dioxides into the atmosphere shouldn't be that surprising. Although I am not a big food waster, but I got to admit I did occasionally order portion of food that I knew I couldn't finish and end up wasting, it might not sound much of a deal but if a lot of people do that it becomes a problem in a different scale. Lastly since I grew up in a country where some undelightful beliefs or "culture" still exist or perhaps thrive, I heard a lot of sayings about how "educations are useless for girls", or "a good marriage is better", and I remember they triggered me a lot. It's not hard to imagine how many developed or poorer countries are willing to discourage women educations and encourage them to give birth to raise the populations for a continuous growth in economy.

I am just so glad to see the list of solutions, since the first week of the class I perceived our future as an unstoppable train of society that runs full speed to our destruction, and what we need to do to save our future is to stop that train with a bare minimum of peoples' efforts (only 850 students in this class, yes it's a large class but we only have 850 more people who knows better about the climate crisis, and some of us maybe will continue to be dedicated to do our parts). As some of the comments say, it's uplifting to see how many of those solutions are achievable and totally within the range of reasons that can be easily accepted by our society at current state.

I particularly found the Reduced food Waste summary interesting because I was able to connect some of the statements with my personal experience. Right when they mentioned if we have ever wondered why we have never seen a crooked carrot in our local market, I stopped to think before I continued to read the rest. I recently visited a local market this week and went over to the organic section. There were many carrots of different sizes and shapes, but I decided to go for the most ‘standard’ looking one. I found this interesting because as they mentioned that there are “quality standards” set by the food chain, from my experience, consumers like myself have adapted to these standards.
                              <br><br>
Another thing they mentioned was that 1/3 of the food does not make it “from the farm or factory to fork” and that the production squanders a whole host of resources. In relation to resources, I want to talk about the hours of labor. This past summer I visited a pineapple plantation in Costa Rica and the tour guide told us that they only ship the “best” to the U.S. and Europe. He also mentioned that the pineapples that did not meet “quality standards” would be kept and used locally; I am still quite skeptical about whether they did keep them or not. Pertaining to the hours of labor, he mentioned two men planted 6,000 pineapples a day on 2 acres. I found this rather upsetting, that the men put In so much work and its almost as if their work is unappreciated when only certain pineapples get shipped.

After reading this week's readings on "Summary of Solutions",  I learned that there are many efficient ways to remove carbon dioxide emissions. This reading was very optimistic and idealistic compared to the previous ones, as it provides numerous explanations on how anyone can (and should) help restore the Earth to a greener planet. One solution that can be contributed by everyone is refrigerant mangement as it can reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 90 gigatons by 2050. Carefully disposing refrigerators at the end of their life are essential because they can release 90 percent of their chemical refrigerants into the atmosphere that can affect our global warming. It is hopeful to know how we can save our environment and planet but ultimately, it is our actions that can only speak for itself. But, I believe people in our class are educated to start a change for themselves and their surroundings.

I totally agree with your statement. And I want to mention that education is also an effective way to help climate change. Education could have positive influence on girls and the next generations. Take girls for example, girls who have education would care more about themselves that they would have fewer children and their kids would be healthier. This could help this planet to slow the population growth and the climate change would not be damaged so rapidly. What’s more, the teacher could also teach their student how to protect the environment and what we could do to solve the climate problems. So, I think education is also a good way to solve the climate change problem.


<br><hr>
After reading the "Summary of Solutions", I was also given a more hopeful perspective of how people can help the environment. I was intrigued to learn more about how these solutions could result in positive changes within the next few decades. As you mentioned, I was also interested in learning more about CFCs and the impacts of refrigerants on our environment. I was surprised to learn that not only have HFCs replaced CFCS  and HCFCs, but that HFCS are going to be replaced by refrigerants such as methane and propane. Making this switch will save nearly 25 to 78 gigatons of CO2 within the next few decades. Learning this has made me more hopeful about the future of refrigerant management and disposal.

I really liked this article because it included ways people can help the environment by making changes in their daily lives. For example, I believe that more should be conscientious when purchasing and consuming food. Unfortunately, most of the food wasted in the developed world occurs further along in the supply chain, when the food is already prepared for consumption. Consumers should be more open to purchasing and consuming produce that may not fit their ideal standards of appearance. Although some produce may not look appetizing, it is still perfectly edible. Making this change can not only help reduce food waste, but can have greater positive consequences such as preventing additional deforestation and the release of CO2 emissions.
                              <br><br>
Overall, I think this article made several good points on how everyday people and our society as a whole can make changes to help our planet. I would recommend this article for anyone who wants to learn more about the different aspects of our society that can be changed to help reduce CO2 emissions.

This reading was very surprising to me. I did not expect the first thing on the list to be refrigeration. I have never before in my life heard of the chemicals that refrigerators release into the atmosphere. I wish more people were aware that something like a fridge, which we don’t think twice about, does so much to harm the environment. I also found it interesting that so many of the issues were associated with food use and the education of women. I feel compared to other countries the west is way quicker to waste food. As a worker in the UCSB dining commons I see first hand everyday all the food that is chucked into the trash. A lot of the food is not something that needs to be trashed, instead this food could be given to food insecure people in Isla Vista. Also, the fact that education of women is so high on the list should be very self explanatory. The reason countries like India have such a high population is due to the fact that women are not educated and know so little about family planning. So many people in these countries have multiple kids even though they can’t afford them because they aren’t educated on family planning. All these issues are very important and there needs to be change so our society and planet can become better.

I think the summary is really well sectioned out. I like that it's listed from largest impact down, and I particularly respect that the estimates that could not be given were explicitly noted. A lot of the angles at which Project Drawdown is using are very creative, since I wouldn't have even thought that land use such as the Peatland preservation and techniques like Silvopasturing were even actual things that existed. I thought it was interesting that a lot of the tactics that were being suggested involved using preexisting "systems" as carbon sinks. I remember Ken mentioning the educating girls and women about family planning and contraception and the like, and while I agree that this should be in place, I think the way that this idea is worded makes it seem that females are a part of the problem. I think males should be held equally accountable as well and they should be targets of family planning too, since it's not just a one way street. I would love for that addition to this project drawdown (even if it's just a sentence tat the end). Overall, this was a really interesting read and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who may be interested in climate change issues going forward.

Really agree what you said.We are at the critical moment of the climate crisis, but at the same time, it is unprecedentedly full of hope and motivation. Young people are calling on us to take responsibility, and almost every week, national governments commit to climate action. Nature-based solutions can be put into use quickly, cost-effectively, and scale up as needed, and can be used in every country in the world. Sustainable solutions that can prevent serious damage to the planet require fundamental changes in the global energy system: the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, and drastic reductions in driving vehicles that rely on internal combustion engines.
                              <br><br>
Promoting public policies that support clean energy development and efficient travel are probably the most beneficial actions you can take for the climate and the environment. But cultural and behavioral changes are also part of the overall solution. It's best to start now.

In Project Drawdown, there were a number of solutions that could be implemented together that would not only save money but the environment as well. A simple combination of the plans could be: silvopastures, tree intercropping and managed grazing. It makes sense economically to combine these and make three facets of the plan more efficient. I would love to see some of the more agriculture based plans be implemented up at UC Davis where they are so agriculture based. 
                              <br><br>

Another interesting thing that wasn't mentioned that could be used to reduce the production of methane at cattle farms is the implementation of seaweed into their diets. One study done by UC Davis implements a specific strain of seaweed that reduces enteric methane production by 50%! (https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-eating-seaweed-can-help-cows-to-belch-less-methane). There are so many ways we can make our unsustainable habits more cost-efficient and beneficial towards the environment. It would be irrational to do otherwise. 
                              <br><br>

Some of the bigger plans on Project Drawdown would be amazing to see implemented, but with our current President in office I don't see any chance of change in the near future. However, it would be interesting to see if there was any media coverage if the entirety of the class starting using social media to tweet/instapost/snap/blog towards certain political figures to garner some attention to certain causes.

I think your comment is pretty insightful. You summarize that “there were a number of solutions that could be implemented together that would not only save money but the environment as well.” Indeed, after reading Project Drawdown, I find that there are actually many ways of protecting the environment without spending too much money. In your comment, you also mention another thing that is related to the reduction of methane, which is an important greenhouse gas as well. According to you, “one study done by UC Davis implements a specific strain of seaweed that reduces enteric methane production by 50%.” I watch the video you provide in the comment, and I am surprised by the effect of seaweed, too. I believe there are still many ways of protecting the environment, and they are not difficult to implement. Like you said in the comment, “it would be irrational to do otherwise.” So I think it is necessary for us to take actions now.


<br><hr>

Really agree with you! Not only seaweeds, other renewable energy or natural plants work the same way. And I believe if we start to use them more effectively, it is certain that the amount of carbon emissions will be reduced and the the temperature maybe controlled successfully without taking the risk that the energy is not enough to support our daily life, since if we only decide to cut the use of fossil fuels without the using wind energy, solar energy or tidal energy, we will definitely face a situation that the quality of life will decline. As we have learned, nowadays in German, many cities, counties and towns are proving that the energy policies of traditional industrial countries can be radically changed, that is, they can rely 100% on renewable energy and they supply enough energy for industry and modern life. I find the implements of renewable energy really exciting, since it’s maybe the easiest and cheapest way to make some great changes to relief today’s situation.



<br><hr>
I agree. These statistics further imply that the progress to reduce CO2 emissions is both tangible and urgent. I personally did not know about the effects of that strain of seaweed either, but I am surprised as to why people have not been talking more about it. The list provided in Project Drawdown is surprising in the way that the main contributor to CO2 emissions is just sitting in all of our houses, the fridge. Everyone is so wrapped up about the fossil fuel industry and its effects, but there is also an easier way to reduce emissions just by reducing the amount of times we dispose a refrigerator. It is also nice to see a list of statistics that express the successes of reducing CO2. We've always been fed sad and depressing facts about how much we are doing badly to the planet, but this website actually lays out the positive things we've done and how much it has worked. It's nice to see a positive and uplifting website about the good things we've done for the planet every once in a while.

I am skeptical about points 6 and 7 but otherwise this project is an excellent recap of what can be done to stop the climate crisis.  I am surprised to see that the number one point on the top 25 list is something that I had never considered. But overall, many of these solutions are completely new to me. It is reassuring to see the sheer number of solutions here, and even more reassuring to see that costs are not as big a problem as some may say. But the irony of this list -- for me -- is in adding frustration to the issue of government passivity. If you can save money and save humanity at the same time, then where's the problem... 
                              <br><br>



As to why I am skeptical about points 6 and 7 is that the authors seem vague in their justifications for them. Maybe I misread, but I did not read any explicit explanation about how these will reduce Co2 emissions. Furthermore, the authors seem to be making a sizeable contradiction. I don't wish to be cruel but, if child mortality *decreases , then this means more children and thus more of a strain on resources*. Not really sure why the authors stressed this point.

I was ecstatic to find that the reading for this week was the Project Drawdown list. Providing solutions to the climate crisis is what the American population needs. These days, it’s extremely difficult to slow down life. Everyone wants things done quickly and efficiently, without much care for what’s going on outside of their current situation. Having a list that provides quick and easy access to solutions may be the way to start a climate vanguard. If people are able to retrieve this information in a timely manner, we may be able to get people to start changing their lifestyles, creating a cascade into a climate vanguard. Reducing food waste and having a plant-based diet are significantly more helpful than switching to electric cars, yet people believe the opposite. It’s the smaller changes that make lasting and significant impacts. I’m quite appreciative of this site, and will absolutely be sharing the information to my friends and family.

I was just as appreciative for the solutions given to help prevent further damage to our earth and to put an end to our contribution towards climate change. It can be very frustrating, overwhelming, and seemingly unrealistic when we are told to make huge changes to our lives in an abundance. It can ultimately lead to people giving up or not trying to develop better habits that promote healthier environments; however, if we start slow and steady, people can eventually lead lives that encourage keeping our earth healthy and inhabitable. I myself felt useless in the sense of helping the climate crisis since I was being pushed and pushed to change so many major things within my lifestyle so quickly. This reading undoubtedly helped ease my stress and made me realize that starting small and slow and gradually getting to where I want to be is better than not starting at all.

I have questions: If these are the most effective changes, why are they not the most widely known? Mainly, we hear about "changing to LED" or "taking shorter showers" or "using less electricity" or "unplugging devices when not in use". Why don't we hear about HFCs, if they're a lot more effective in mitigating climate change? Why don't we hear about the successes of solarfarms and rise of onshore wind turbines? I did not know it was cheaper than fossil fuels. I did not know it was that viable.
                               <br><br>

I am glad the authors focused more on the women's rights for population reduction instead of just the environment. It is also nice that instead of making it about "that country is overpopulated", they focus on the overall population. I also didn't know that we're aiming for a 9.7B max population by 2050. That doesn't seem too far off from the projected 10B. Another thing I didn't know: 45% of pregnancies in the US are unintended. Even in a developed country. Surprising.
                               <br><br>

I am confused about the difference in carbon sequestration in soil organic matter and above ground biomass is accounted vs below-ground biomass, which is mentioned in chapter 5. What is below ground biomass?
                               <br><br>

Ken is right, and the most effective changes are cultural, such as population growth and food waste reduction. I like how the changes are win/win for people, the economy, and the environment. I wonder where the idea that it has to be "environment vs people/economy" comes from.

The roadmap provided by project drawdown is an impressively composed tool that governments and other institutions must seriously consider. After researching their top 25 ranked solutions, I discovered that the most impactful solutions to diminishing greenhouse gases is through cultural change, such as converting to a plant based diet, wasting less food, and educating women. While green technology like electric cars and solar panels draw the most attention in the media, they should not be our main focus in combating climate change. We must apply more pressure on developing countries to educate females which will result in a decrease of unintended pregnancies and supply women with easily accessible contraception. In developed countries, we must be more conscious of how wasteful the food industry is, and how over-consumption of food products is detrimental to both our health and our planet. Thus, more policies that aim to reduce the amount of food being wasted in supermarkets should be enacted. Additionally, discourse surrounding food waste must be made prevalent in widespread society to prevent consumers for buying more food than they need.

I agree that policies and discourse might help in reducing food waste and that education among young adults should be enforced as well. I believe that the most impactful solutions aren't difficult to reach. A plant-based diet, reducing food waste, and limiting the amount of pregnancies isn't quite challenging as others. These are cultural changes that are possible if knowledge on these solutions are shared globally. Whether it is shared within a developed or undeveloped country, resources to be able to achieve these changes must be accessible.

It is surprised fact for me to see that how refridergrator played a determined role in the climate change. I did not even know the way we keep our food cool and fresh was such a huge impact on co2 emission. In the video, although it caused a more severe problem in our environment in 1900s and trying to fixed in 1980s, it still had an impact to our environment and atmosphere. Besides, the website truly gave us insight of how we can do to save our environment. And, it also tells us how much food we have wasted and most americans are such wasteful people. so it is time to take action.

It’s quite unsurprising to see some of the solutions proposed by Project Drawdown. We’ve been told over and over again what the effects of our fossil fuel addiction are. The problem here is that developed countries like the United States are not only reluctant to implement some of these solutions, but the fossil fuel industry is going to great lengths in order to ensure our consumption of fossil fuels. 
                               <br><br>

I knew there was a correlation to population and the education of girls, however I did not realize it could have such a great impact on carbon emissions- “ It could result in 51.48 gigatons of emissions reduced by 2050”. That was surprising. Unfortunately we live in a world where women suffer from different forms of oppression - be it education, working wages, voting rights, or something as primitive as giving birth. Project Drawdown states that 225 million women in lower income countries say they want the ability to choose if and when they want to become pregnant - but lack the access to contraceptives. Funding to both contraceptives and education for women are crucial, but I think what is equally as crucial is the reestablishment of the institutions that oppress women. You can’t have all of these changes if the country or institution continues to propagate female oppression through toxic masculinity or stereotypical female roles. 
                               <br><br>

Before reading the summary of solutions, I knew a plant based diet was going to be a solution. I think presently -the general population (adults at least) is aware that a plant based diet is both healthier and environmentally sustainable - we’ve had this conversation plenty of times. What I want to know is when we are going to act on it, this is knowledge. Like Prof.Ken stated in one of his lecture videos, “ Knowledge is power, if acted upon”... and squandered power if not. And that is exactly how I can describe our predicament with plant based diets. Up until 2016, I was quite unaware of the impact that animal based protein production and consumption has on the environment. I say 2016 because coincidently, it was the year that I first saw Cowspiracy. To say the least, I felt upset and guilty at such a revelation - but I also felt angered. Angry at the fact that I was part of this vastly unsustainable culture of mass animal protein consumption. Since then, I have made changes to my life and helped my family change theirs as much as I could. I no longer consume dairy or meat - I have kept fish and poultry is my diet - but at a very minimal amount. Almond milk alternatives and Beyond meat products have become a staple in my diet.

This week’s reading is a list of approachable tasks we could to reduce our current carbon emission, it’s very informational and easy to understand. Each solution stated the estimated total gigatons of CO2 we could reduce if we follow the instructions, a detailed IMPACT section is also included, which explained the main idea and purpose further while summarized.
                               <br><br>
One task I want to pick and discuss specificity is number 3, Reduced Food Waste. I chose this task because it is the topic we are discussing this week and the one I believe would be the most approachable for me as a college student. I personally prefer the university dining commons than restaurants. First is because I have a clearer choice of what I can eat and I trust the food, second is because I have a lesser chance of wasting food because I always get what I can eat. I am not stating that eating outside means wasting food, you could always ask for a box and take the dish back home and enjoy. On the other hand, eating in the dining common doesn’t mean food is all being eaten. I have meals in the dining commons almost everyday and I’ve been to every single one, and when I put my plates and bowls back to the vending area, there will always be something left in the tray not finished, sometimes the whole dish.

I am also gravitated toward the third task, as I feel this would be fairly easy to achieve in my life right now. I will agree with you that the dining commons does have its perks for college students for the reasons you state. Our dining commons at UCSB bring it a step further and are environmentally conscious in their decision to implement a composting system for its daily food waste. The convenience and variety provided is only another reason to choose it as opposed to aimlessly wandering through IV settling for a food place that you may not really want to be at. Cooking for oneself is another better alternative: you can cook as much for yourself as you would need and leftovers can be saved for later or passed on to a friend. I am glad that this is a small choice that I can make that can have a huge difference in the climate crisis.

After reading the 25 solutions from he Project drawdown, I literally have both reliefs and some concerns towards the climate crisis issue. The good thing is that there are multiple ways for ordinary individuals like me to do so as to protect the environment and reduce personal carbon footprint. The simplest and effective way is the food approach. For example , we can reduce the waste of consuming excessive food, and change our diet into more plant-based ones. This really make me think of the “ Green Monday” of our dining halls. Initially I really hate this sort of things, because I think it makes the food less appealing than it used to. However, later I found that it was one of our university’s efforts to protect the environment. Now I am really proud that I could participate in this and help to fight against the climate change. Furthermore, we can also contribute to the reduction  of carbon footprint on a broader range. The society or the whole world could deal with the environmental problems though the widespread of education and knowledge, agricultural advances, reformation on land use, and seeking for cleaner and sustainable fuel and energy. These solutions could be incredibly effective to the current crisis if everything goes smoothly.
                               <br><br>

However, enforcing these ideal solutions is definitely a tough progress and requires long period of time. Even if the solutions can bring about much benefits to us, there are actually millions of cost behind them.For instance, the Silvpasture can significantly reduce the  agricultural carbon emission, and generate considerable economic profit, it would also require  a huge investment into that as a cost. Moreover, even for the most accessible food approach to people, it is extremely hard to call up for a big portion of people to change their diets into more plant based ones, given their various backgrounds, cultures and beliefs. It is also a matter of self regulation to reduce our unnecessary wants… All that sort of things is a challenge of us to do.And maybe that is one of the reasons why we say climate crisis is a big issue because it forms easily but requires plentiful resources including time and money to deal with. 
                               <br><br>

Understanding that there would always be sacrifice to the success, I still firmly believe that if the majority of us could make a small step, the fruit of our efforts would be a huge difference in the world.

I too felt a combination of hope and concern after reading the 25 solutions presented by Project Drawdown. It is a relief to read about all of the ways that the climate crisis can be addressed , somehow making a monumental problem feel more manageable (if not for individuals then at least for those that are actively emitting large amounts of carbon). I found that this material was organized in a way that is extremely effective without being excessive. Often it is necessary to include a range of information with such a complex and deep rooted issue, but I also think that people are generally going to be more receptive to succinct information that quickly gets the point across. I found that with each new category I was presented with the necessary information to assess what impact I can make and to be educated on the steps that can be taken by others. 
                               <br><br>


I was most intrigued by the topics that addressed educating girls and family planning. I had no idea that this factor could have such a profound impact on the reduction of carbon emissions. I think that I was unaware of this fact because I have led such a privileged life, specifically regarding reproductive health. Beyond having “the talk” with my parents, I participated in multiple years of sex education, receiving critical information about how to navigate sexual health, regardless of sexual activeness. Even now, there is constant information and resources being provided to students at UCSB, something that is not available for millions of girls across the world.

I was very shocked to learn that the number one way to reduce carbon dioxide entering the air would be to change the materials we use in our refrigerators. No one ever talks about how polluting these materials are whether it be the general public or even the environmentalist movement. I just learned this information today, and I like to think of myself as a flaming environmentalist, so how are people who do not care that much about the environment supposed to know this? I really liked reading about all of these potential solutions and it was nice to see the tangible results that these changes could have. As someone who cares about the fate of nature it is sometimes very difficult to stay hopeful and visualize how change will actually occur. This drawdown allows people to see real change that can occur and shows me that there are people out there that believe these changes are possible and have done the math to prove that changes like these ones can have huge beneficial impacts. I think that a lot of them will be difficult to implement, as many involve huge social and cultural changes, but ultimately I think that change may not seem so impossible as it once did. I also learned a lot of new information from this website about potential solutions to problems that I didn’t even know posed a threat. I also learned that peatlands store twice the amount of carbon that the world's forests do, and they only account for 3% of landmass. All of these solutions sound so promising and I can only hope that we will begin implementing them as soon as we can.

Projects drawdown suggested some of the easiest and most logical solutions to the climate crisis by tackling many different areas, such as energy consumption, overpopulation, dietary adjustments, and many more. As Ken points out in the introductory video, the main cause of our carbon footprint is transport. Simply buying a car is the equivalent to our energy budget for the next 40 years according to the Paris climate accord, and this is without even driving it once. The next biggest proportion of our individual carbon footprint is housing. If we simply get rid of our cars, live in energy efficient housing an eat a plant based diet we could cut down the majority of our carbon footprint. However, this is ver unrealistic to expect people to change their lives so drastically in order to protect the planer. People like living comfortably and as they please regardless of consequences to the environment or other people. Projects drawdown suggests, to my surprise that changing refrigerant management is the most effective way to cut down our CO2 emissions. I never considered the impact of refrigeration and air conditioning to be such a large part of the carbon emissions being put out in the atmosphere. What really grabbed my attention is the fact that 90% of the emissions by refrigerants are released at the end of lifetime, meaning that is we simply find a better way to recycle and discard our refrigerants we will be able to significantly control the emissions coming from them, which according to project drawdown could reduce our emissions by 89.74 gigaton by 2050. 
                               <br><br>
The second main topic was electricity generation, mainly by wind turbines, wind unlike fossil fuels is an unlimited source of free energy, once we invest in wind turbines we can have unlimited, free energy generation, this could reduce our carbon emissions by 84.6 gigaton of CO2 by 2050, another very important part of our carbon footprint. We are already making advances in this department, 2015 was a record year for building onshore wind turbines, with 63 gigawatts being installed around the world. 
                               <br><br>
The third topic was food, projects drawdown addressed the issues of food waste, diet and land use. It is widely known that reducing our meet consumption will reduce our carbon footprint immensely, less carbon and methane will be released, tropical rainforests won’t be burnt down to accommodate more space for the beef industry, such as the recent amazon rainforest fires. The burning of those rainforests causes a huge release of CO2 by itself without counting the CO2 that won’t be taken up by the plants that were there and the land use for farming will also cause massive releases of CO2. Combined our diet and land use could save 151.54 gigaton of CO2 from being released by 2050.
                               <br><br>
Finally, the last point which grabbed my attention was educating girls and family planning. These are less direct methods of addressing the climate crisis, but overpopulation is one of the main causes for the increase in CO2 emissions, therefore, reducing the number of people in the planet os one of the best ways to limit emissions. By far the most effective was of population control is educating girls. Almost everywhere on the planet now birth rate is almost equal to the replacement rate, meaning population is not growing anymore. In countries where girls are being educated they have fewer children, more of them survive, and they are in charge of their reproductive health. This could lead to a decrease of 102.96 gigaton of CO2 emissions.

As I have followed the progression of the climate crisis in the media,  I find myself getting extremely frustrated as the the issue of how to fund the “radical” solutions is always brought up. In the simplest sense, essentially everything that is carried out by the government costs money. This is unavoidable. This issue is not a matter of the government not having enough money; it is a matter of the government allocating mass amounts of money into the wrong places, specifically regarding the military. The United States spends more on defense than the next seven countries combined. Yes, it is entirely necessary that the government allocates money to the military but that is just heinous. All of the solutions proposed by Project Drawdown are pivotal in the scheme of the climate crisis, but they cannot be realized without immediate action and funding. Why is so much money being spent to defend a country that will likely not exist in the near future?

I completely agree with you. There are many people who believe in climate change, but are unwilling to take action because they think it will be too hard, too inconvenient, or too expensive. this is why I, too, was pleasantly surprised to see that a lot of the things listed in Project Drawdown were really doable. Changing air conditioning, for example, is really easy and I think is the kind of changes that people are willing to make--it doesn't affect their daily lives and it has no impact on their daily decisions, yet it has such a huge impact. A lot of the other things on the list, like the ones pertaining to food and land management, will affect people's day-to-day lives very little, making them fairly easy to implement. However, you bring up a great point of money. Project Drawdown points out that although each of these steps requires an initial, often expensive, investment, the return on investment is far greater. We can save money while saving the planet! However, our government is still focusing on the wrong things. Instead of paying a little bit of money to invest in our planet (and save more money in the long run), our government is propping up an over-sized military. As voters, we have the power to change what the government spends money on. We can demand less military spending and demand more investments in mitigating the climate crisis.

It’s kind of amazing that the first three top solutions don’t cost money to enact or at least don’t say they do. Reducing food waste sounds like a very easy thing to do culturally and morally. I’ve always been taught not to waste my food, so to hear that a third of all food produced is wasted is saddening. Educating women is easy to do in first and second world countries as it has already been adopted into our culture by the mainstream, but seems like a much harder task in third world countries. It would be a welcome change, but many destitute countries don’t even send the men to school. Some of them also don’t educate women for religious reasons, so trying to change their mind would be changing the culture of their religion which can be dangerous. Changing to plant-rich diets also seems difficult to do. Meat eating is already a part of western culture and will continue to be until meat producers like cattle ranchers lose power over government. This also applies to foreign countries such as Brazil as mentioned in Cowspiracy.

I think that on the contrary the three solutions listed above will take a combination of money and effort. Reducing food waste sounds like it should save money, but often times it is cheaper to have mass produced food than locally produced food.  These large corporations are often able to buy specialized machine because of how large scale they are and in order to end food waste we would likely have to switch to local sources of food which tend to have much higher operating costs and be less efficient. I support the change to a more local food economy because I believe that it will support family farming and will put money back into the pockets of the middle/lower class instead of the pockets of already ultra-rich corporations. They often use some of this money to lobby congress to maintain or worsen conditions so they are able to operate with lower costs or take advantage of people. Also, the process of educating women in foreign countries would take a lot of effort and money to achieve. I honestly do not even know how one would go about effecting change in this area as these countries seem like they would be conservative in the traditional sense of the word and would be resistant to any change. I see this problem in my parents homeland. India has a lot of problems with giving women equal rights and education as men will feel threaten by any positive change and will riot in response. It is a slow cultural shift that needs to be going much faster. Even in America I see people using straw mans to denounce feminism. They say that they are threatened because of the words of an extreme minority. They make "jokes" about feminism and women that often betray what they really want. Convincing people in the US to become Climitarians would also take advertisements and promotions to do, which costs money.

It's great to know there is a solution to all this chaos that is happening to the world such as the Project Drawdown. It's a guideline and intrusctions on how to stop increasing our carbon footprint and worsening's the earth's ozone. The project practically has a solution for any item or place that we might create a destructive carbon footprint and how we could better it. Not only that but it made me aware of other object that could be damaging the earth such as refrigerators since literally everyone has one in the developed countries. However, it'd be hard to implement such changes to our lives since many people don't like change if it's put out as voluntary, because then no one would do it unless it becomes obliged. I would not have like it to get like this but we must then a forceful approach more than a voluntary would help us regulate our weather back again. Another way would be if it became a trend to do all these things like having a plant-based diet or taking the bus/train. If these sort of things became popular then we'd have no trouble going back to period of cooling and warming at normal rates instead of what is happening now.

I strongly agree with your points here. It is refreshing and almost reassuring to see that there’s a list of actions that we can participate in individually or collectively to reduce our carbon footprint. The same solutions - although very important solutions - are always being repeated over and over again when discussing ways to fight climate change, such as transitioning to a plant-based diet and use more public transportation. However, Project Drawdown definitely expanded on many more solutions and explained their impact. For example, I didn’t know what silvopasture was until I read this article, I didn’t know that wind turbines will be #2 on a list of solutions towards climate change, and I didn’t even know that the food we waste contributes only 8% of global emissions, I say “only” because I was honestly expecting a higher number. Furthermore, I also agree that at this point there should be a more “forceful approach” applied to us in order for these solutions to actually go through. No one really does something on their own unless it’s popular/trending or a law. Therefore, I do think it’s time to push our comfortable lifestyle a bit.


<br><hr>

I agree with you regarding how people are reluctant to change their ways in order to reduce their carbon footprint because they’re too used to their habits. I do understand that people take a while in order to change their habits but habits can be changed if they have strong willpower to do something good for the planet. I think what influences others to change their habits if other people encourage them because a lot of people are easily influenced by others and in today’s society, everyone is trying to fit in so they won’t be called out. If people with fame are able to use their social media platform to inform people about what they can do in order to reduce their carbon footprint, I think this will make a significant change in the global carbon emission percentage.

Wind energy is at a very important place for reducing global warming. And we can tell from the rankings that both onshore and offshore wind turbines are within the first 25 approaches. Especially onshore wind, it is in the second place of all. It has a lot of advantages, costs comparably low while maintaining high performance, and the costs are continues to fall as new technology develops. It also has no fuel costs, no pollution, only take small footprints, and easy to build. For offshore wind, growing from 0.1 percent to 4 percent could avoid 14.1 gigatons of emissions, that's an astonishing amount. Moreover, wind turbines can deliver trillions of net savings over three decades of operation. Lastly, I want to say that besides wind turbines the other things on the rankings also are the ones we heard so many times before and are pretty familiar with, we know the solutions now, it is time to put in actions.

“Project Drawdown” is an interesting text. It has a straightforward rank that most people would like and has a short summary of each solution and its effectiveness. It is quite shocking to me that managing refrigerators could be such an effective solution. Before that, I thought that actions such as adopting plant-based food, using LED lights, and reducing the use of fossil fuel cars are enough for an individual. Although the statistics are shocking, they make sense — this electric monster contains chemicals such as CFCs and HCFCs, which have been known for a long time to causing ozone layer depletion. Looking at sectors, I find out that 17/50 solutions belong to “food,” showing how much impact our food habits can have on the environment. Yes, many of them are about agriculture that we cannot control, but this should not be the reason that we are not responsible for it. After all, we are those people who choose to consume those products massively. Besides, women can play an important role. We should empower women with knowledge and rights, letting them joining human beings to solve the issue of climate crisis together. This truly shows why we should also consider the issue of climate change from a humanistic perspective.

I completely agree. It is quite simple, straight forward and easy to understand. I had the same reaction to the impact that refrigerators have on our planet! I never knew that this everyday necessity had so much to do with the amount of harmful greenhouse gases there are in our atmosphere. I was also shocked and disappointed to read about the amount of food our country/world wastes. I know, personally that I am very guilty of not finishing my meals/not eating my food/letting things go bad, so this was a real wakeup call for me. Lastly, your comment about educating women is completely relevant. Overpopulation/the fast growing population can be easily solved with something as simple as sex education- something that everyone is entitled to. It's important for us, as a planet, to collaborate and realize that our future is dependent upon making change- we should stop thinking about climate change as a political issue and instead look at it, like you said, from a humanistic perspective.


<br><hr>
I also thought that the "Project Drawdown" was an interesting and straightforward text. I think that it is the perfect read for people who want to know exactly how they can make a big impact on the climate crisis but do not want to read a bunch of lengthy articles. Like Ken mentioned in this lecture video, I found the reading slightly surprising because I was expecting to see some things in the top 25 like cars and air travel (considering the fact that those two topics were highly stressed in class) but instead discovered that other things that I had never heard before were more impactful. For example, before this reading I did not know what Silvopasture was. I think it is important for more people to read this list because I feel like some people do not know where to start when it comes to how they can take action in combating climate change and this list offers them several different ways in which they can help.

It was really nice being able to read an article that gave me a glimpse of hope for our future. A lot of the readings we have been assigned have left me sad and made me lose hope for our lives and environment. I found it intriguing that this article presented a variety of different topics that showed how we could reduce Co2 emissions in simple ways. There were many topics that I didn’t even realize could help reduce Co2 emissions. With this being said, I think this article is crucial for everybody to read because it could help reduce our carbon footprint and save our future. I found the food topics the most interesting. The third thing on the list to reduce atmospheric Co2 emissions was to reduce food waste. I think this is one of the most important things we as individuals can do and incorporate in our lifestyles. It is so easy to waste food from time to time but we need to seriously cut back on this. The food we waste is responsible for roughly 8% of global emissions. Not only is this a personal change we need to make, but manufacturers and food industries need to fix this problem as well. A third of the food raised or prepared does not make it from farm or factory to fork. After taking into account the adoption of plant-rich diets, if 50 percent of food waste is reduced by 2050, avoided emissions could be equal to 26.2 gigatons of carbon dioxide. Being able to cut back on food waste is such an easy change we can make, and it can have a huge affect. Another topic was switching to a plant based diet. Not only would switching to a plant based diet help reduce Co2 emissions, but it will also have serious health benefits as well. According to a “2016 study, business-as-usual emissions could be reduced by as much as 70 percent through adopting a vegan diet and 63 percent for a vegetarian diet. $1 trillion in annual health-care costs and lost productivity would be saved”. If saving the planet isn’t enough of an incentive to switch to a plant based diet, is saving your health enough of an incentive? Again this is another easy switch that people can make in their personal lives to help reduce their own carbon footprints. ANother topic I found interesting was educating women and girls. Currently our population is growing rapidly and this is partially due to women not having the right resources/education. This rapid growing population is emitting a lot of CO2 into our atmosphere. Currently, the world faces a $5.3 billion funding shortfall for providing the access to reproductive healthcare that women say they want to have. Besides the point of reducing Co2 emissions, women should automatically be able to have the rights to education and healthcare for their own health. If they were able to gain this, we would be able to reduce Co2 emissions significantly because our population wouldn’t be growing as rapidly.

I agree that it was refreshing to be able to learn about the different solutions to the crisis we're facing. Now that we've learned about the coming consequences, it is time to analyze all the solutions to keep us from reaching the worst effects. I liked how this article focused on issues at the macro level rather than the micro level. Ken brought up this point when discussing how we are told to unplug our phone chargers, and while little changes do matter, they do not compare to the massive levels of damage being done through corporate production. The fact is that turning the faucet off while brushing our teeth, which we should all still do, is not going to fix our water crisis while the beef industry remains producing at its current output. The core of solving climate crisis has to be at the macro level global scale change in our means of production and lifestyles. Project Drawdown addresses the issues that need to be fixed in land use, food production and energy as well as the social issue of female empowerment through education and family planning. The solutions offered are very reasonable and makes ecological sense. We need to start using the earth for what it has and learning to live cohesively and maintain productivity sustainably. I found the land use solutions very interesting as it discussed the billion acres of abandoned farmland that could be restored. Our throwaway culture even extends to land as we deem it worthless. Afforestation, farmland restoration, and conservation agriculture all interested me as there are so many ways to manage our land better and sustainably. The end result is both productive and ecologically sound. The energy alternatives such as solar and wind have been obvious alternatives to me, and it is truly angering that they have not been implemented on a wide scale due to the political power the fossil fuel industries hold. Again food has been made clear the most important and easiest to change solution to climate change. The world needs to shift its focus away from meat, that is the one thing each of us has the power to change. It is harder to shift the energy sources due to the power corporations hold over the government and we are not all famers but we do all eat. And we can pick what we eat. That is clearly the most effective and "easy" change that can be enacted immediately but it still has yet to take off because it is such a personal decision. The push towards plant based diets needs to come from a bottom up approach and be enforced through a top down decision to start making plant alternatives easily accessible and appealing. Overall, this article was very interesting to me as it analyzed all the very realistic and impactful solutions there are to combat and stop climate change. With these solutions, we need the power to be able to carry them out through education, voting and personal choices (diet).

-    Reading these “Summary of Solutions” indeed made me a little bit more optimistic about the climate crisis but not all the way. Although there are so many things, we can easily do to reduce emissions, there are still so many more people on the planet that either don’t know or won’t do it. Also, knowing that 11 out of the top 25 solutions have to do with food, reducing our meat consumption and food waste will take a lot of convincing in a lot of different places. I am completely behind changing my eating habits to help the cause but I’m not sure how many people would be okay with doing that. I think that’s why it is important to educate people who don’t know about the serious causes and effects of climate change because the more people that know the more people can make the difference. 
                               <br><br>
-       Also going off the fact that the top 3 solutions make more of a difference than ALL of the other solutions combined makes it hard to actually see the difference that they make. I’m glad that in Ken’s video he touched down on the fact that on a personal level we can reduce emissions by using less transportation, having smaller housing, and better food production.

Before reading the “Summary of Solutions’' from Project Drawdown I didn't know the extent of refrigerants such as HFC’s were such large emitters of Co2 in our atmosphere. A shocking fact was that it was first on the list, that if they are successfully phased out, they will spare our atmosphere 89.74 gigatons of Co2. After watching Before the Flood and Cowspiracy, it isn’t a shock to me that 11 of the 25 top solutions are food related and the fourth one being a plant rich diet. I am now well aware of the extreme impacts meat rich diets have on our planet, from the land use, water use, methane from cow farts, etc. It seems as though all of the sustainable farming solutions not only help the planet tremendously, but improves the farmers profits as well. For example, regenerative agriculture has no tillage, diverse cover crops, in-farm fertility (no external nutrients), no pesticides or synthetic fertilizers, and multiple crop rotations which makes organic rich soil organic matter that will reduce the carbon footprint of farmers as well as helping with farmers to consistently reuse land. One of my favorite sustainable methods mentioned was silvopasture, which is raising pasture between trees. Not only can the farmer grow food in the trees as well with the cattle, but the cattle can have shade and the more trees can be on our planet to help limit our Co2 levels.

Me too! I am so shocked when most of the most environmental unfriendly things it mentioned appears in our daily life, such as our diet, and the stuffs we used.  Refrigerator is really a shocking fact for me. And we can see that we really need to make a difference to our diet to. make them environmental. eating less meat, and having more plant-based diet and water less food is really what we should in our daily lives.

Tons of solutions have been provided in this week’s reading, Project Drawdown. I was thinking about if all those solutions can apply into reality, our lives will become much better sooner or later. Among all the options, the one that intrigues me most is solutions concerning women. The project providing idea that if the society can offer more eduction opportunities to women, and make women have their choices of when and whether to be pregnant, the overall carbon footprints will reduce tremendously. One of the major problems that we are facing in today’s society is the continuously increasing global population. Those women who didn’t receive proper education would tend to have more and unhealthier children, which is both a suffering to those family and as well as to our planet. And according to a recent research, over a half of pregnancy now in the U.S. is unintended. Women have even no rights on whether and when to have babies; it is ridiculous. And back to our topic, unintended children also adds to our overall carbon footprints. As we can see, even is other kinds of solutions are efficient enough to cut our carbon footprints, if we do non control the world population to a sustainable amount, solutions can never world if the population continues to grow. In 2020, the world population will reach 10 billion. At that time, things are even harder to get solved.

I also have concern over the real cost of putting those solutions into real life which might somehow gives people more reasons not to doing so because the large economic lost it brings. The problem now is not merely stop using refrigerators or air-conditioners alike, we have to learn how to recycle or at least purified the equipment to make it ready for reusing while eliminating the total number we have the equipment in households.
                               <br><br>
Also, as Ken mentioned in the video, over the top 25 solutions, there are eleven related to food. We’ve learnt before that animal husbandry especially beef industry contributed to nearly 15% of all greenhouse emission in world, and that emission can be largely reduced thus helping with the temperature control under relatively low cost. We should really rethink that whether human need that many livestock and weighing for the future of our next generations.

It was relieving to see the list of ways to reduce carbon/greenhouse gas emissions. Often times, I struggle finding ways to reduce my carbon footprint, but it gives me hope knowing that I can employ simple methods of climate friendliness. The list did a great job with not only providing a throughout yet straight-forward explanations, but also in establishing credibility by utilizing statistical power though it was number heavy. I was mislead to think that certain things would have the biggest impact on the environment when in fact those things were quite down the list. The most interesting thing, which Ken mentioned in class, is education of women. Educating our women would not only lead to family planning which would help combat the issues of over-population, but it will also improve society as a whole. There are so many little things that every single person can do to mitigate the climate crisis, so there is really no excuse. Sadly, hindsight is better than foresight, so it might take a severe occurrence for people to realize that actions must be taken this moment.

My favorite thing about this reading was that on the right side of each summary there was a IMPACT section that showed just how helpful each solution would be, how much they would cost, and how much it would bring down emissions. I learned that 35% of food from household of high income families is thrown out. If we were to educate women and children we would reduce emissions by 51.48 gigatons by 2050. By having family planning we can stop the population from growing an additional million people over the United Nations 2015 medium global population projection by 2050. The sad thing is that the number one way to help on this list, phasing out HFCs is projected to cost $903 billion dollars. We need investments in our planet rather than investors in the stock market. Yet the impact sections still made me hopeful. For example, they predicted that conservation agriculture will continue growing from 177 million acres to peak at 1 billion acres by 2035. I think this is a step on the right direction and it will end in profit because implementation costs are low at $38 billion with a return of $2.1 trillion. I also didn't realize that just having a plant based diet could reduce emissions by 66 gigatons. Like I said earlier, I learned the most from the impacts the suggestions in this list would have on the planet.

Likewise, I was pretty shocked to see that environmental solutions for food production as well as land use for food production took up essentially 13 of the top 25 on the list. When Ken discussed ways for us to individually minimize our carbon footprint in previous lectures, I had considered switching to a largely plant-based diet one of the easiest things to do (as opposed to, say, letting go of cars). This week's reading has only reaffirmed that sentiment for me because of the massive impact that consumer diet seems to have on the planet. On a different note, however, I was confused to see that Refrigerant Management sat at number 1 on Project Drawdown's list. I hadn't even considered that to be something so bad for the environment, and it's definitely ironic that the thing that we rely on most to keep cool could lower the Earth's temperature by 1 degree Fahrenheit with its destruction and replacement. It's great to see that there are natural refrigerants out on the market already.
<br><hr>
I also liked the impact section.  I feel like throughout this class, I've lost a lot of hope about the future, but this reading helped me realize that what I chose to change about my life does have an impact.  It was interesting to see just how much each action helps the climate crisis, and that the least fun things are typically at the top of the list.  I relate it to my own family and found it funny that my dad likes to show off his Tesla as being efficient, but my mom ordering from Imperfect Produce (sends out produce that is usually ugly and would thrown out) has more of an impact.  I also found it interested how interconnected everything is.  It would be simple to give people access to family planning resources, but politics and personal beliefs get in the way of something that would prevent 51.48 gigatons of emissions from being added to our atmosphere.

I really like how you said "We need investments n our planet, rather than investors in the stock market" because that is the root problem! All these environmental issues stem from refusal to give up wealth. Money trumps our planet almost always and it's a fact that gets me down constantly, that nothing will change because money has too firm a hold on our society and governments. That makes sense of course, but what doesn't make sense is allowing the planet to die and us to die with it just so we can live "lavish" lives. I really do like how this article (report? not sure what word to use) includes all the benefits and how to go about implementing these changes and the cost and the gain. This has been, in my opinion, the most important reading we've had. It provides a glimmer of hope, especially in ways to help the environment that increase economic gain, since that seems to be the only driving force to people in power.

Project Drawdown is important because it illuminates how people can most efficiently reverse climate change. This program offers many surprises in that most of the most productive solutions are not often talked about it in the media. As a kid, I always believed that changing the lightbulbs in one's house and shortening showers are the most effective way to reduce harm to the environment. However, I now know that these changes are microscopic in terms of personal impact compared to things like switching to a plant-based diet or forgoing car transportation. Up until recently, if I were asked to list the best ways to mitigate the climate crisis I would never have mentioned effective refrigerant management. This is an issue that is largely overlooked by the general public because it is seldom talked about in the media. I was blown away when I read that the Kigali Accord, and the subsequent replacement of HFCs that come with it,  can reduce global warming by a whole degree Fahrenheit. 
                               <br><br>
Project Drawdown does make me realize how vital political involvement is in order to enact real change in slowing down the climate crisis. For example, the second most productive step in ameliorating the climate crisis is implementation of more Wind Turbines. This is a change that requires change on a scale bigger than individual changes. Yes, switching to a plant-based diet and changing housing/transportation habits is crucial but those changes must be supplemented by changes above the individual. It is clear that Wind Turbines have potential to make a huge difference in helping stop the climate crisis but until the government ceases to favor coal-industries, it will be hard to proliferate this solution. I was not even aware of how big of a change the Wind Industry has the potential to make. It is a very attractive form of energy, considering its zero fuel cost and absence of pollutants yet only 3-4% of the world's energy is supplied in this way. The monolith of the fossil industry needs to be confronted and the government must begin to favor alternate forms of energy. This collusion between the US government and fossil-fuel industries will only be stopped if people participate in elections to put people in power who are aware of, and seek to solve, this problem. 
                               <br><br>
I did not know that 8% of global emissions were contributed by wasted food. Unrealistic expectations in the produce market are responsible for a large portion of this waste in higher-income countries. I had never really thought about why I so rarely see unique, or less than perfect, produce in grocery stores; now I know that massive quantities of food grown is wasted because it does not meet the high standards of the food industry. 
                               <br><br>
I hope that the solutions proposed by Project Drawdown are more widely disseminated so that people can place proper values on the steps they take to help the climate crisis. Many people have limited time and effort they are willing to expend on helping the environment so it is important that they spend their energy efficiently.

After reading these 25 ways about reducing CO2 emission,  I think besides citizens, companies should understand the serious about the climate crisis. Within these 25 ways, many solutions are about companies, such as raising animals. Not everyone has the chance to change things that they are not capable of doing. Therefore I think companies should also play a role in improving the environment condition. Also, just as Ken said, there are many unexpected ways of reducing Co2 emission. After reading them, I have a better understanding of what I can do to reduce my CO2 footprint.  Even it sounds ridiculous, it can still help to reduce the emission of CO2.

Yea, I agree with your sentiments. I’ve always wondered what significant changes we can do to our lifestyle that can help reduce CO2 emissions and this list was very helpful in figuring that out. I was really surprised to see refrigerant management as the top 1 on the list. Substituting our fridges for ones without HFCs is apparently a massive way to help collectively bring down CO2 changes and it is one that won’t really change our lifestyle in any way. This seems like a no brainer for me. It is also important, like you said, to hold companies accountable as well. Number 3 on the list was food waste. I feel both producers and consumers need to take food waste seriously as it is a huge waste of resources that go into producing food.

After reading the 25 solutions, I strongly felt that the major problem that those solutions imply is about farming and diet, such as plant-rich diet, solar farms, Silvopasture, and regeneration agriculture. Relating to the course materials taught last quarter in English22, I suddenly noticed that farming and agriculture might be the starting point of humans excessively exploiting our Earth. At the very beginning, people are nomads so they won’t use land repeatedly since they are randomly moving. The deforestation and soil erosion could be traced back to when people settled down to cultivate, like the very early Egyptians. Now, we have a massive amount of people living on the earth who need to eat. Of course, we need larger land and faster techniques to cultivate to feed all the people (though they are also lots of people starving). This causes the question we have now. Those who live in a rather good life tends to waste, and the poor suffer. However, the market is changing for people who consume foods, so they will produce more and more, overusing more lands. If we can change our diet, we not only solve one question, we will solve a series of problems. If we waste less, the market will produce less. They will need less land. There will be fewer emissions and water and soil loss. If the government could also manage to allocate the market more equally and efficiently, there will also be fewer people who starve. When people don’t have to worry about food, they can be more efficient in doing other things or maybe they will have the time to learn and get educated, so the population could also go down.
                               <br><br>

I think eating healthier and waste less is probably the easiest two things you could do to make a lot of change on this list. It doesn’t take any extra efforts like spending money to build a solar panel in your rooftop. Obviously, only doing this probably is not enough to influence globally, but I think this could be the first step.

How to reduce our climate footprint? Many people view this as a difficult task. However, it is indeed simple: we can reduce it by biking more other ways mentions in the reading. For different governments in the world, they can reduce country's footprint by building more wind turbines and solar farms. These new energy will reduce carbon emission and global warming effectively. For individuals, we can reduce climate footprint simply by reducing food waste. For the whole world, organizations like Unicef can improve women's education and reducing high natural population growth rate in the world. When the population is not growing so fast, the pressure of the world will also decrease. People also need to learn to live in peace with the environment. We have to respect the nature and be thankful about natural for what she has given to us. The most important thing related to global warming is deforestation. Forests like Amazon is our lung of the earth, and we should always protect him. Otherwise, our life quality will also be influenced.

Upon looking at Project Drawdowns explained plans for reducing emissions I was thrilled. Seeing all of the actions we can take, and how they will impact the environment is very important. I think that people do not realize how small actions within their lives truly change the world around them. There were also many many concepts in here that I had not heard of. Of these, the most interesting to me were all the changes we can make to agriculture. I personally find this area incredibly interesting. Regenerative agriculture was very interesting me, and I found myself a bit dumbfounded as to why we have not already implemented this process. Although it may be slower than other agricultural practices, it is far better for the crops you are growing. Something else that stood out to me was the number presented in regards to Temperate Forests: "99% of Earth's Temperate Forests have been altered by man in some way." This statistic was disturbing to me. It is painful to picture this, as I am someone who likes to think that their are. still some places out there untouched by man. I think that this page should be spread around far more in social media, because it brings up so many statistics that I have never seen before. 
                               <br><br>

This all being said, I do have some questions around the ways these solutions are proposed. Recently I was reading the LA Times, and came across this article: "Wind turbine blades can’t be recycled, so they’re piling up in landfills"  ( HERE is the URL to copy and paste: https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-02-06/wind-turbine-blades) It states that although wind turbines are a far better alternative for energy, they do in fact produce a lot of non-degradable waste. I feel as though the Project Drawdowns page should have included ALL information about each of their presented solutions. I understand that including this information could lead to criticism from non-believers, however it made me feel uneasy about completely trusting the websites numbers. I think this wind turbine article would be a great one to take up in class, as Project Drawdowns had Wind Turbines listed as number TWO on their summary of solutions, despite the problems that come along with them. We are constantly remodeling and throwing out old turbines, and it needs to be addressed. The article makes it clear that they are looking for a biodegradable way to build them, but this doesn't brush away the issues at hand. I hope Ken sees this comment and is able to share his thoughts. I would love it if other people looked at the article as well, and shared their thoughts.  
                               <br><br>
I have always been team Wind Turbine, and am struggling here with how I feel after reading the linked article. If anyone else has similar feelings, please feel free to share.

I really enjoyed the ideas presented in project drawdown. Not only was the proposed plan coherent, detailed, informative, etc. it was simple. It was easy to see the impacts each of these 25 different ways of reducing carbon emissions could make. I particularly was drawn to the layout of the website. It was rather easy to navigate and provided an accessible layout that anyone surfing the web can get to without hassle. I keep on mentioning the layout and the information presented by project drawdown because I believe the way they presented their information and the simplicity of their content makes a huge impact on the reader. The webpage was simply a cornucopia of statistics, facts, and figures. I also noticed how self changes and cultural changes like shifting to a plant-based diet made a bigger impact then a lot of technological advancements. What fathoms me is I have never heard of Project Drawdown until Ken introduced it in his course. I’ve seen numerous ads for climate change that focus on such smaller things like solar, LED, electric cars, etc. and the question of “why is project drawdown not seen everywhere?” immediately popped into my head. It is crazy to see how much advertisers manipulate the public to make a profit, but even more crazy that the public doesn’t question authority.

I loved reading the Project Drawdown's "Summary of Solutions!" I especially liked how the rankings not only depend on the impacts of each solution, but also depend on the genuine efficiency and feasibility of each solution. Think about it: electric cars are #26 on the list. Electric cars would help immensely with reducing car pollution but there are still a lot of pollutants emitted when making the cars. Also, not everyone will buy electric cars. On the other hand, almost everyone uses refrigerators. If HFCs can be removed from all refrigerators, those emissions that come from disposal of refrigerators with HFCs will be completely eliminated. It just has to do with banning the sale of refrigerators that contain HFCs. Banning the sale of cars that use gas would be a lot harder to do. There is not so much “hype” for specific refrigerator brands than there is “hype” for specific car brands/companies. I love how Project Drawdown considers solution feasibility, an aspect that is often overlooked but is just as important as efficiency.

I think we can tie this back to Cowspiracy and the problem of animal agriculture. While I completely agree with the intentions behind forgoing meat, I don't think saying that we all have to stop eating meat is the best solution. While it would be extremely effective if we could actually make it a popular and frequently implemented solution, it would be very hard to implement and therefore it is not feasible. A better solution would be improving our farms and corporations -- and we do that by supporting sustainable agriculture and environmentally-friendly businesses. It's an easier change and it's more likely to grab peoples' interest.

I too appreciated the inclusion of feasibility within project draw down’s solutions. I think that looking at options that can be done now and with relatively low costs are our best bet. These solutions would be eating little to no meat, wasting less food, educating women, and ensuring access to family planning. All of these solutions pose little to no cost on the consumer and instead tax and punish the institutions and corporations for their malfeasance. 
                                 <br><br>
I do, however, severely disagree with your stance that forgoing meat is not the best solution. I do agree with you that we need to change the way we farm and use the land for agricultural means, but no matter how you manage your land, the emissions that come from raising animals for food is disproportionate. If there was a way to make the emissions of eating animals zero, then I would be totally on board. But until that happens I think everyone who has the means should switch to at least vegetarian diets. This reduces 63% of emissions for vegetarians and 70% for vegans.
                                 <br><br>
Moreover, changing the way animals are raised for food does not change the immense cost humans bear for meat. Factory farm workers have one of the highest suicide rates demonstrating the high cost for maybe 20 minutes of good food. Moreover, eating meat has been directly linked to a number of health issues, some even being fatal. Regardless of emissions, thinking that switching to a plant-based diet is asking too much is not really a feasible response, especially given the emissions and numerous alternatives available.

I agree with your statement that cutting out meat is unrealistic for everyone for many reasons. Of course, cutting back on meat consumption is entirely possible for many, especially Americans who have access to other protein sources that mimic meat. Project Drawdown highlighted agricultural practices that seemingly take us back in time to how people raised animals and grew crops hundreds of years ago, before technology and mass production. Although using un-tilled land and crop rotating takes longer, it's much more sustainable for the soil, and cows' waste produces free fertilizer. I think that reversing our practices will give people higher quality food, and people can still eat meat if they want to in a more sustainable fashion. 
                               <br><br>
Centuries ago, meat was a luxury food. Most people relied on grain, corn, and plants to get their nutrients. With technology, we've mass produced meat because it's in high demand. However, if we regress a bit and view it again as a luxury item and treat it more as a condiment than a base, I think that raising cattle and other animals in harmony with other agricultural practices will be feasible. 
                               <br><br>
I appreciate Project Drawdown's comprehensibility in outlining the biggest issues. It's always felt unclear to me what the most urgent issues contributing to the climate crisis are. Not only does Project Drawdown highlight in order what the issues are, but they offer SOLUTIONS. It's interesting to read about how women's education and access to birth control can be as pressing as deforestation, land use, and food waste. Popularizing many of these overlooked or unconsidered ideas alongside the meat industry and the problems with car use is the next step.

I also found this reading to be incredibly helpful and easy to understand. Sometimes it's hard to face the idea of climate change and just how much we need to do. Like, where can we start? This list very plainly lays out: here, we start here, these are the most effective ways to help our planet. It also is interesting that the solutions we are taught from a young age generally aren't that great of solutions. Electric cars, unplugging your charger, they're almost like putting a bandaid on a broken leg. They may have look nice, have cartoon characters on them and everything, they may even cover up a knick, but they don't address the real problem . The fact that refrigerant management is the number one thing we can do is insane. Who would ever even think of that? I suppose we should know to look for refrigerators without HFC as consumers, but let's be honest, no consumer is checking that. It should be the government that checks all that. In fact, I think the government should be checking all of the things on this list. Why has no one just sent this list to literally everyone in their local and national government? Wouldn't it do us all good if the people in charge knew what should be done?
                               <br><br>
However, I don't think having people live with meat-free or meat-minuscule diets is really that difficult to implement. Educate people, young and old, about the adverse effects. Max taxes higher on animal products. Have government-run agencies like schools only serve vegetarian options. People can change if you give them the chance.

I also thought that the rankings stood out to me because there were many things that I didn’t even know about such as peatlands, geothermal, and clean cookstoves. As Ken had mentioned, things like solar panels and deforestation weren’t first on the list. I also noticed the Project Drawdown's "Summary of Solutions” rankings had the list based off of, as you put it, “the genuine efficiency and feasibility of each solution.” Especially because not as many people can afford things like, as you mentioned, an electric car. It also did a very great job at explaining things in great detail where it is comprehensible for the reader. What really shocks me is why this list isn’t more known, especially because of the fact that it is realistic and feasible. I feel that most people, even if mostly educated on the subject would almost be shocked to read this list, with refrigerant management at number one. Although solar panels and deforestation are important, the people should shift their focus to these solutions such as food waste and land use.
                               <br><br>

Although I understand where you’re coming from in regards to animal agriculture, I disagree. I also don’t think that the solution proposed is to cut out meat entirely, but take steps to limiting beef and chicken consumption, even if it's once a week (meatless Mondays). I don’t think that more people are more likely to support sustainable agriculture and environmentally-friendly businesses because of the fact that this could raise the prices of meat and people will become more unhappy. Also, you would have to get the farmers on-board, which could cause them to lose their profit because their production output would decrease.

Ken's idea that cultural change is what it takes to stop the climate crisis seems to be largely confirmed by Project Drawdown's solutions, but still, many solutions do rely on new technologies (but just as many on 'old' technology). I noticed that the Project Drawdown website provided many ways to organize and rank the solutions, and I found that there were some interesting trends. Within sectors, "Buildings and Cities" and "Transport" solutions ranked surprisingly low in terms of the emissions that they reduce. On the other hand, cultural/educational solutions in "Women and Girls" have trivial costs (only $5.3 billion for the needed family planning) in comparison to large scale technologies yet have immense carbon impacts. 
                               <br><br>


As for focusing on technological innovation, increased efficiency in electricity generation in wind and solar farms seems to go the farthest, since these rank #2 and #8. Wind and solar also show up later in the top 25, still surpassing technologies that have enraptured the American public today like electric cars and smart thermostats. These sorts of immense changes in infrastructure and changing how we power the grid require top-down change in the form of political and energy company action as opposed to a strictly personal, cultural change. That is not to say that personal lifestyle changes can't play a role, however. As Ken mentions, changing to a largely plant-based diet and reducing food waste can prevent hundreds of gigatons of CO2 emissions. Owning rooftop solar ranks #10, a simple installation. Therefore solutions to the climate crisis need to focus largely on the personal scale in how we eat and our relationship to stuff, but also on the global scale in terms of energy generation and agriculture. 

                               <br><br>

That brings me to the most surprising thing I found from this list: the immense amount of agricultural changes that can be made. Many of those changes reject what has become traditional agriculture, where the land is tilled for annual crops and fertilized, then eventually 'used up'. Instead, agriculture needs to look to nature, biodiversity, and actual ecosystems when it comes to sustainability while maintaining consistent production. The truth of pesticide/herbicide resistant GMO crops is that much like treating every infection with antibiotics, resistance to harsh chemicals grows over time and the treatment becomes less effective. Instead, the monoculture needs to be replaced with methods like tree intercropping and multiple crop rotations. As for livestock (and crops to feed them), the massive government subsidies need to get cut back so the price of beef (or any ruminant) reflects its true cost. New techniques like managed grazing and silvopasture will reduce the overall productivity of the beef industry, but will in the long run be a far more sustainable practice. These techniques are best taught peer-to-peer among farmers, but on a larger scale the beef industry that emphasizes maximal production needs to be fought. Again, this further emphasizes my point that change needs to happen on multiple fronts, globally and locally, to mitigate the climate crisis.

I greatly appreciate having the summary of solutions as our reading this week since it informed me about the reality of what will have the greatest effect in combating climate change. Throughout the course, each week’s focus seems like it has a catastrophic influence but this chart really puts everything into perspective. It is mindblowing that unplugging a charger for an entire day only accounts for one second of driving a car. I was not exactly surprised by what was on the list but the order of some of the terms was not expected. Once again throughout the course, the significance of a plant-based diet is highlighted. I was definitely surprised to see that refrigerant management was at the top at number one, since it is something we have barely touched on. When thinking about all the causes of anthropogenic climate change refrigerant management is not something that would come to my mind without great thought and honestly probably some research. I would have never thought to think about the impact of leaks from refrigerants and the carbon footprint of a production of a refrigerator. Additionally, I really stand by the importance of educating women as well as men. I understand the statistics behind the study that women that are more educated have less children, but I also see that a large contributor is the lack of family and access to contraceptives. Additionally, women do not produce children asexually. Not only sexual education itself is very important but access to proper sexual education would benefit more than the environment and our next generations. Luckily, organizations like Planned Parenthood are devoted to helping in low income areas to ensure proper education as well as family planning and other resources. However, this is proving to not be nearly enough family planning as we need due to it being number seven on the project drawdown list. I believe that educating people on not only climate change as an issue but realistic ways to make a big influence is what we need. In Cowspiracy Kip showcased the fraudulent ways of some of the leading climate change organizations who are unaware in part or avoiding the true changes we need to make. If project drawdown was more well known maybe this knowledge would change the impact that people choose to have. Some of the top twenty five are much easier to apply to one’s everyday life than some of the other things that these in your face organizations are asking of people.

Everything that Ken has been putting out for us to read/watch has been extremely crucial for us to be educated on. These summary of solutions taught me a great deal of information, some of which I was already aware of, and others were mind blowing because I would have never even thought of. I was glad that the summaries were very short and to the point. Providing just the right information - explaining the key points of each solution and how they can mitigate the climate crisis. Also, if one wants to learn more about a certain solution they can go down to the technical summary in which it goes into more depth. I believe that Project Drawdown did a great way at presenting these solutions especially with the Impact summary on the side, helping one see how useful the solution is.  
                               <br><br>
I like how you brought up the importance of not only educating women but also men too. When I got to that part in the reading, I too thought that we should also educate men due to the visible fact that producing children is a two man job. Based on the statistics given by Project Drawdown, educating women would make a huge difference “in how much energy, building space, food, waste, and transportation would be used in the world…” Now imagine the EVEN BIGGER difference if men too received the proper sex education. There needs to be more classes on this topic and it should be taught at a young age to inform the younger generation on these issues.

The ultimate question that we environmentally have is how to stop carbon rise? The two solutions that Ken provides is that it should be primarily person and secondly collective or global. Transportation, housing, and food are all things that we can control for sustainable energy. Upon looking over the top 100 things that acquire the most carbon footprint, it was really baffling how much food waste or hydro-fluorocarbons in refrigerators have such an impact on our carbon footprint. Food waste in particular was interesting to hear about since people automatically think that transportation has a higher impact on carbon footprints. Well, I thought that this was the case before I saw the data. Population is also a contributing factor to the problem as the more people there are, the logical pattern is that there’s going to be more waste created. In 2050, the population is expected to reach 10 million.

I agree with you that education in general is important as it helps us become environmentally aware of our surroundings! In fact, the reason we continue to take this course is to learn out things like this. Although change is scary, the little things accumulate to contribute as a whole. I think that becoming more environmentally friendly will truly help make the home we live more livable.



<br><Hr>

I completely agree with your analysis of the importance of education! Due to this course I have learned a substantial of information regarding not only the climate crisis itself and what constitutes it but how to alter my own actions to aid in my own decrease of carbon emissions. Seeing myself as an example as to how proper education changed my habits I am extremely confident that the same technique would create a large difference in the problems we face with having climate change be on the forefront of all people.

Like most, I found it so interesting how many things are really dumping heavy emissions of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. Like Ken suggested, I always thought that the main cause of emissions were things like cars or planes, but I would have never guessed that the leading producer in greenhouse gases was a refrigerator. The fact that HFCs have one thousand to nine thousand more times the capacity to hold heat than carbon dioxide. The heavy hitters in emissions turn out to be food production in land use. At first I did not really think of these things as producing a lot of emissions, but the more I think about it the more it makes sense. With cattle producing methane and the soil not being able to contain any of it or absorb surrounding greenhouse gases, of course emissions would be higher. It was crazy to see what other small things I never thought of can be related to the current climate crisis like women’s education and family planning. The long chain of events from cultural to personal changes go a long way. In the case of women education, these changes in the long run reduce the amount of people on the planet, reducing carbon and saving resources. 
                               <br><br>

I did not even find the most helpful part of the project is not the issues that cause the most emissions, but the things we can do. For a lot of the issues, the solution was the title, like the turbine sections. I just found it interesting how we have so many options and most of them are not costing any more than the options we use that produce more emissions. A good example of this is CSP, turbines and PV panels that are decreasing in cost and have the capability to sustain major cities and even countries. This makes it even sadder that we aren’t doing what we can as a society to curve the problem and even reverse it. It is time to take some sort of action and start to check some of the issues off the list. A lot of them are also very doable. Like I said before, with most of the top 25 emission issues, there is no cost deficit, so it is just a matter of people changing their habits, which will help productivity and the planet. I think we can get to the point where our top emission leaders will be different within 5 years or so.

I felt the same exact way when doing the reading. I fully expected to see car travel or something similar at the top of the lift, but seeing refrigeration was a total shock.Reading through the rest of the list turned up more surprises, such as family planning. It became quite clear to me that with some minor adjustments to our daily life. I found Ken's point about changing diet and food waste very poignant. Working in a kitchen, I see firsthand just how much good food is literally tossed into a dumpster. I believe much of it can be saved, even if it may not taste was good as it did while fresh. While I can appreciate the great effect a mostly plant based diet can have on reducing emissions, I just don't see the majority of people being able to make that switch, including myself I hate to admit. Maybe as more vegan based options come out and the taste continues to improve, more and more people can begin to make the transition. overall, this article was both insightful and interesting, and it gave me a lot to think about in my daily life.

Can we talk about the plane/transit thing, honestly? Because I just... it's hard for me to trust the numbers here. Maybe I'm being an antiscientific fool (in which case I'll totally renege on my point), but... cutting down on plane usage and/or having electronic mass transit doesn't even hit top 25?? Seriously?? I don't... I legitimately don't get it. All the previous climate change data I knew about lists planes as a huge source of carbon, Ken seems to think that planes are literally the worst thing for the environment (and for good reason), we talk about them a lot, but... they're not even here? Nowhere to be found on the list in the top 25? I... I am confused. 
                               <br><br>

Maybe this is supposed to be for easily-implementable solutions? Seeing that "transitioning off of fossil fuels" and/or "not using planes or cars" aren't in the top 25, that could be the case. But then... well, "not eating meat" is honestly just as radical an ask for people, if not MORE radical, than asking them not to use a car, and that's right up there at the top. That's certainly not easily-implementable. So am I just wrong? Is everyone just wrong? Is this wrong? I am very confused here! 
                               <br><br>

City planning isn't included... public transit is barely included... I don't think planes are on the list. Some of the solutions are really novel and are ones that I've never thought about, yes, and the reading emphasizes some vastly important things. But I'm just wondering if I've been focusing on the wrong things this whole time, or if this reading really is leaving some stuff out.




<br><hr>
 I understand where you are coming from. With how much time Ken has spent dedicated to teaching us about how air travel and cars are a leading cause in emissions. The only reason I believe they are not on the list is because while we think of these things as being very prevalent in our day to day lives, in the scope of the whole world, they aren't as popular. Cars have just started to become popular in other countries like China and are starting to make their way to poorer countries. The amount of CO2 produced by cars now is relatively small to the other issues on the list because cars are not really in service all over the globe, and planes are even more rare. I believe Ken mentioned how 1 out of every 10 people have ever been on a plane and a lot of people in the US who are wealthy make up that amount that has flown. While planes may be producing numerous tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, the relatively small number of plane rides taking place along with how new air travel is with it not being a popular means of travel for even a hundred years. So while I understand what you are saying, it will still take a considerable amount of time for planes to be of the same importance when it comes to cutting down emissions in comparison to land use and food production.

After reading 25 solutions, these solutions show us how to mitigate the climate crisis, and also let me understand the impact of these solutions on our personal carbon footprint. As for the management of refrigerants, only after reading this article did I know that the refrigerants of our common refrigerators and air conditioners have 1000 to 9000 times the impact of carbon dioxide on climate warming. And I thought that wind power has gradually become the mainstream. What I didn't expect is that now wind power only provides 4% of the world's power. There are 80 different plans shown on the website, each of which has a positive impact on the mitigation of climate warming. Although there are so many plans, I think the most difficult thing is how to stick to the implementation of these plans. After all, in the past so many years, many plans have been put forward. But in the end, these plans did not stick to implementation.

I agree with you, this reading informed me of many solutions I hadn’t known about prior to reading, especially refrigerant management. By being this far into the class, I am aware of how we can use different means of transportation along with having fewer children as well as switching to a plant-based diet in order to improve climate change. However, many of the changes brought up in this reading were a lot more specific and included things I never even realized were making such a big impact on climate change. As interesting as it was to read about these plans, I also worry about the implementation of them and how successful they could actually be. I do, however, believe that in the near future we will have no choice but to refer back to plans such as those included throughout this reading in order to navigate through the climate crisis. 
                               <br><br>

In order for this implementation to happen, people need to be aware of the facts of climate change and the many, many things we could and should be doing to help improve our current situation. Although I have some knowledge on climate change, there is still so much more to it I feel I learn about everyday. For example, something really shocking to me that I wasn’t aware of before reading was regarding plant rich diets, that “If cattle were their own nation, they would be the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases”. Or that as for family planning in the U.S., “45 percent of pregnancies are unintended”. Although I’m aware of the fact that these aspects play a huge role in climate change, it’s the actual statistics based facts such as these that really make the difference in allowing people to realize how much of an issue climate change really is, and what make these solutions included throughout this reading that much more important.

It’s time to get serious about stopping the rise of global greenhouse gases and getting to the point where these emissions are declining. What do we need to do? Ken mentions that there’s two solutions that go hand in hand: personal and global. It’s important to make differences at home and also speak up against injustices so that we can make differences on a larger scale. Solutions such as taking shorter showers and unplugging mobile phone chargers when not in use only do so much. Tiny gestures are important, but we need to think bigger! It’s like voting. You might not think it’s important in the grand scheme of things but your voice really does matter. All the tiny gestures add up.

This reading was very motivational. I appreciate the list  because the ways that I can cut down my carbon footprint in a clear format. There are 80 different solutions! Amazing! It bothers me when people say that individual actions don’t have a significant impact. I truly believe that it takes one person at a time to create real change. All the homework assignments that Ken has assigned us all have the similar theme of it takes an army. We need to band together and collectively consume less, waste less, etc.

Re-reading all my comments up to this point, I see that I have slowly taken on the view of optimistic to pessimistic. This reading gave me some hope. There's a lot of depressing films and readings and articles, but that's because they're all trying to get everyone's attention on how bad our planet is getting and how we all need to do something to reverse the effects of climate change. The top effective ways of reducing greenhouse gas + CO2 emissions are easier than expected--they're so easy, if everyone were to make these changes it could really make a great effect on our planet. I've slowly eased away from believing that small changes won't make an impact and that we're so far gone that only big and immediate changes will be effective, but reading this made me a little more optimistic and reminded me that the first step everyone needs to do is start with themselves and it will all hopefully cause a huge beneficial domino effect; these changes will just become a part of people's everyday lifestyle, the bar will be set a bit higher and the next change we make will be bigger. I'll definitely be saving this blueprint for myself and hopefully pass this on to others. Thank you for assigning us an uplifting and more positive reading!

Opposite from you, this class has been making me change from a pessimistic person to more of an optimistic person. I can see how the readings and films that Prof. Hiltner assigns can definitely be disheartening but I think that these materials are necessary if we want to enact any real kind of change.  In the past, we've scraped the bare surface of climate change because of the fear of public outrage.  I think that this public outrage is necessary to attract the attention of those who can easily ignore these problems: aka the top 1% of the American nation and other Western countries.  The solutions proposed by Project Drawdown is realistic enough so that people aren't enraged by radical solutions and will remain more open minded for the future .The wide range of solutions given by the Project Drawdown gave me hope that anyone can implement these changes in their lives.  If we all can implement one solution from the article into our own individual lives, we would be one step forward in combatting the climate crisis.

It is refreshing to learn about multiple ways in which we can positively impact the environment. Mostly I have been learning about the more depressive and frightening issues that have caused climate change from the past decades. This list of solutions not only gives me hope for the future, it makes me realize that there are people out there who are fighting and truly care about the earth. It feels like most people although the know about climate change carry on in their lives continuing to have the same wasteful habits and choose to ignore the fact that we are nearing a potential extinction of the human race which will be cause by humans. Some of the solutions are relatively easy to do for example number 7. Family Planning. We already know that the Earth is over populated but by just informing people and planning your family you can slow down human population growth which will then slow carbon dioxide emissions. Sadly, around 225 million women have an unmet need for family planning and just over all education.

I completely agree with you, what we have been learning so far makes me angry and annoyed about our society and how it choices to ignore global issues such as the climate crisis. However, the list of more than twenty-five solutions aimed to minimize the effects is uplifting because we know that there is, in fact, more that we can do and a lot of these solution plans are being implemented right now. What is left to do is implementing these solutions on a global scale to observe a definitive change in the toxicity of our atmosphere.

After reading the statistics from Project Drawdown and Ken’s video explaining it, I became very optimistic about our ability to solve the climate crisis. The solutions that this project offered seemed very doable and Ken’s explanations were very clear. However, I can see how many people would still reject not just some but most of these possible solutions because either they don’t think that climate change is real, or they don’t want to make significant changes to their daily lifestyles. I really liked the alternative option of solar panels. This extremely viable and useful solution literally uses energy that would otherwise be wasted. I have to say that many of the solutions that Project Drawdown presented weren’t surprising, but it was nice to see them listed because it added some credibility because they agreed with my previous knowledge. Also, the project is upfront and lists the ways we can lower our carbon footprint and the harmful actions, including animal agriculture, which many organizations might be scared to list. Overall, I hope more people can see Project Drawdown as a useful resource and I hope they can use it to change many of their daily habits.

I definingly agree, project drawback is such a different way of looking at the climate crisis. Looking at the plan it almost seems feasible. I am worried that a large portion of the general public will resist the impending cutback on things and food changes that come with a lower carbon footprint. I was also happy to see that so many of their plans to help the climate crisis involved the agricultural practices. I currently see food as the easiest of the behaviors to change. We have seen that plant based is desirable and people are willing to support it. Other steps that were mentioned on the list that I think should be at the forefront is the education of people in our society. The more educated the masses are, the less kids they are likely to have. This can dramatically reduce the amount of greenhouse emissions by reducing population growth. It is unrealistic to believe that the earth can hold 7.75 billion people and all of the food they will eat and things they will buy. At a certain point there are just too many people on this planet for everyone to have the food necessary to thrive. So while I agreed with many things on Project Drawback, I was most aligned with food production and population regulation via education.

I feel confident on the issue of mitigating global warming, if we really have that much corresponding solutions. However, I believe these solutions are not appeared in recent years. I thought long time ago, some of them were already appeared. I am worrying about how many of them are really done by people, instead of just being sayings. If there are many solutions while people don’t do anything, we cannot mitigate the global warming.
                               <br><br>
On another hand, I wonder how many more solutions can be given. These 75 may not be enough.
                               <br><br>
Also, most of the solutions targets at human behaviors such as eating habits. These are the hardest problems, and are the most effective solutions. If people change these habits, not only the global warming can be stopped, but also their health condition can be improved.

Yes, there could be many more solutions to the climate crisis, but those given by Project Drawdown are a great start. These are the most important issues that can make the biggest impact so I think we should start with these changes.  Taking action on these recommendations can create major changes that we must see in order to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions.  Therefore, the first step would be the implementation of these solutions.  Once these solutions have been implemented, it would be the time to expand and look to other potential solutions that could continue to change and maintain our reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
                               <br><br>

I also agree with what you said about these solutions being those for the world and for people.  The solutions have vast impacts which is exactly what helps motivate people to implement them.  For example, plant-based diets allow for the global environmental impact to reduce and people have a healthier diet which allows for decreased rates of diseases and health issues.  Therefore, if the environmental incentive isn’t enough for people to take action, then health benefits would combine with it to be even more persuasive.  This expands to those that deal with women’s education, family planning, land use, and food production among many others to take action on the most pressing of issues that can create the best and largest positive impact regarding not only the climate crisis, but also social and financial issues.
                               <br><br>

Overall, the solutions presented by Project Drawdown are important to consider and begin implementation as soon as possible in order to combat the climate crisis in a timely manner before time runs out.

<br><Hr>
 I just recognized one detail from those ‘solutions,’ and that is, the cost of these solutions. I guess some people may think that these solutions are so expensive that they don’t want to use them. Yet, I believe if people continue polluting the Earth, the cost will be much higher. Therefore, it is necessary to implement these solutions.
                               <br><br>
I think there should be laws and regulations start to be made to remind people to change their lifestyles in order to protect this planets. At the same time, deal with the big factories would be necessary.

Compiling an extensive and in-depth list such as this is a great benchmark in the fight against climate change. With statistics and stories, to great ideas about possible solutions, Project Drawdown illustrates tangible steps that can be taken on the individual and global level to reduce our carbon dioxide output (or sequester carbon from the atmosphere through plants). Refrigerant Management being the top solution to reducing our atmospheric output of carbon dioxide comes as a bit of a shock to me. I understand that CFCs contribute greatly to the greenhouse effect, but I was unaware of how they were released and at what point in their existence, but I can see more clearly now. What was unsettling was that the projected cost of destroying these refrigerants is over $900 billion, which leads me to believe it will be hard to implement since many people will probably think there are better things to spend money on. Onshore wind turbines show great potential for carbon emission reduction with an upfront cost but great payoff in years to come. Reducing food waste is ranked as the third best solution for combating global warming, and also aids other important issues, such as deforestation and food inequality, especially combined with a plant-rich diet. Educating girls has a return on investment that is “incalculable.” These are all solutions that may not generally come to mind when one thinks of reversing or stopping the effects of climate change. This is what makes Project Drawdown so special and important.

That being said, solar as an option opposed to fossil fuels makes so much sense, even when comparing jobs and profit. Solar is going to save trillions in operational costs once functional, so the argument for money and economic growth is invalid. The plentiful offering of solutions that can be implemented at the individual, local, global, or systematic level should give us some hope that there are options out there that are both feasible and positive. Most of the top solutions presented have a good return on investment, helping local people, farmers, and the often disadvantaged. Additionally, these solutions can improve the overall wellbeing of a lot of people, such as girls receiving an education, or Indigenous Peoples receiving solar to help power their homes.

I agree with this comment. I appreciate that we are being provided with things that we can not only stop doing in our daily lives but also practices that we can work into our lives. It is very helpful in reducing the amount of anxiety that I feel about being helpless when it comes to climate change. I also agree that refrigerant management being the top way to reduce our carbon emissions was a shock. It was shocking as my family uses the air conditioner during summer religiously, and we obviously use a fridge year round. These appliances are so ingrained in our daily lives that I had never even stopped to think about their environmental impact. I also never would have thought about how important it is that you dispose of your refrigerator correctly. I also agree that some of the issues were more common sense, but still appreciated that there was a complete list, ranked, on what we need to pay attention to and how we can all do our part to help stop the climate crisis.

Those are some really big numbers that have been said in the video. Did not finish the food in the pates is a really common thing that happens, I believe, all around the world. People feel nothing about wasting all of that. ⅓ of the food that people eat every day has been wasted. Considering how many people are still starving or even to death, and how many people can those food save, people should not wast those, or at least buy less than they usually do. I remember Ken once said that our dining commons are adjusting the food they make according to the food that has been wasted, and that is what everybody should do. Not just the food waste problem, making the food that is not going to be eaten is waste of everything. However, we are lucky that we have a lot of influencers who would like to stand out and call for plant-based diets. Because of them, there are more and more people who become willing to switch their diet, which will result in benefiting the environment.

Project Drawdown succinctly labels the major changes our society needs to work on in order to see our carbon footprint decrease. I think it is such a valuable and informative website that should be spread around. Awareness and education of the general population and more importantly those who are skeptics of climate change is incredibly important. What we as a class have talked about quite often is the need for a reduction in food waste and an increase in people following a plant based diet. What stood out to me was number 6 and 7 on the list, educating girls and family planning. Focusing on these two alone would reduce over 100 gigatons of carbon dioxide. Giving people education and god forbid, their own autonomy, should be already happening. The fact that we have to fight for these injustices is wrong in itself, but the fact that just educating girls to reduce the world’s carbon footprint seems like a no brainer. Another no brainer is promoting reproductive justice. Just by giving women access to contraceptives such as birth control pills, IUDs, condoms (male and female) also decreases our carbon footprint because it is a type of population control. What frustrates me the most is that these women have no control over their own bodies because it is on the institutions who restrict education. The main sources of labor are from structural adjustment policies; fast fashion, agriculture, “eco-tourism”. All of these jobs are for the benefit of first world countries, meanwhile the third world countries suffer from low-wage jobs, deteriorating health, monocrops for export…. I could go on.

Project Drawdown was the first thing that gave me any hope this quarter. As I was reading, I kept thinking, if only politicians, who love their money so much, could see how much better the economy would be from these switches. I was intrigued to see how each of the topics would directly and indirectly affect the emitted greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. Especially, knowing now that food waste is such a big deal. However, I’m interested in how to minimize stores from throwing away their foods and how to be more conscious of how much food I waste given that my family doesn’t have a compost or food waste bin and so our food waste inevitably goes to a landfill. Seeing different modes of transportation at relatively high levels on the project was interesting to me, as I felt that Ken had made it seem like it was almost futile to switch to EVs.

It's crazy to see how the media never really shows the effects our diet and food waste really have on the planet and only show that an LED can save however much on your light bill. We really need advertisements on if you were to change your lifestyle habits you can easily help the planet in a significant way. The media does not focus on that though, and don't really care to either. I agree with what you say when we need to turn to people who have interest in helping the planet instead of money. One way we can help by spreading the word of how to better the planet is by using social media. By using social media we can give real ways of saving the planet such as going vegan or use public transportation instead of driving everywhere. Although the media is not doing much to help others change, we can help.

I am surprised that we can just manage refrigeration, and then we can stop climate change. Also, after reading the first 25 methods, I find that it is not that kind of hard to reduce carbon emission. It offers a lot of possible things that we can do to “solve” global warming. I learned a lot in this class, I never heard the theory of educated women that the more educated women there are means fewer pregnancies and less carbon footprint. This is so interesting but makes sense.

I think a comprehensive list of solutions to the climate crisis is simply amazing, and Ken is right, this is exactly what we’ve been asking for after enduring the rather depressing first half of the course. On a rhetorical note, Project Drawdown did an excellent job creating ranking the solutions; its simplicity and cleanliness are easy to follow, and they provide ample sources to support their claims. Many scientific readings struggle to make their research, works, and findings user friendly – presenting an abstract or difficult to imaging statistic with a confidence interval or something of the sort – however, I found the reading enjoyable, clear, and quick; even those who are not as familiar with the climate crisis could navigate it easily. This is of profound importance, as systemic change requires the support of the masses and research means nothing if it’s not communicable.
                               <br><br>

My favorite solution is the education of women and girls, number 6 (and arguably 7). I think it’s amazing that a shift in behavior and cultural belief has a larger impact than many of the other solutions, namely technological ones. This truly speaks to the real issue behind the climate crisis as a sociologic issue. This segment on educating women made clear that human rights and environmental issues are deeply intertwined; as the site states, the priority is the empowerment of women, well-being, equality, and meeting women’s needs are the priority with the planet’s improved health as a positive externality.
                               <br><br>

Another favorite is number 14, tropical staple trees. It was surprising to learn that most of the agricultural crops are annuals, which, as a garden familiar, I know is degrading to soil nutrients and certainly not sustainable. By planting perennials, we could effectively sequester more carbon, produce more food, restore soil nutrients, naturally filter groundwater, and provide stable root systems to eliminate erosion. According to Project Drawdown, an average of 1.9 tons of carbon per acre per year would be sequestered for decades. It seems natural to do this; in the time of hunting and gathering, it is more reliable to gather food from a long-standing source than risk replanting one every year. I wonder how something like this could be implemented.

I agree that the Project Drawdown list is really impressive, and I really enjoyed reading it and realizing these solutions were well within our societies' reach and ability to perform. However, it also made me feel upset and frustrated. Many of these changes are extremely doable, beneficial to human rights, and often profitable, as shown in the various impact statements. I don't understand how we can see this information laid out for us and still not change, but it is apparent by the course of our government and economy that we do not plan to. I generally take a positive view of humanity and like to believe in the best in people, but after seeing our government do so little when the solution is so achievable, I feel really disappointed in the systems we are perpetuating and see a great need for a complete political and economic change in the way our country is structured. 
                               <br><br>

On a more positive note, I love how educating women and girls is included, as well as reproductive healthcare accessibility. I know a lot of people tend to blame overpopulation as a cause for the climate crisis, but few look at the true cause of our rapidly growing population, and how the solution to it is making sure the women of the world are valued more. As a feminist and environmentalist, this solution made me really happy to see, and I'm excited for the impacts of its implementation in terms of both social and environmental justice.


<br><hr>
I too agree that this week's reading was highly user friendly both in its approach and how it presented itself to users. 
<br><br>

I'd also have to agree that solutions 6 (and 7) are both of incredible interest. Recently in my POLS6 class, we addressed the same approach, and it's impact on country development as well. Most notably in South Africa. In order for countries to truly create equality for its citizens, priority needs to be placed in assuring equal access, and in this case specifically education and contraceptives. By implementing the above mentioned, literacy rates improve, gender representation, as well as a slower growing population. It's interesting to me too how answers such as these have not been fully executed, and how many present issues hold social ties as well. 
                               <br><br>
One other I found interesting was the use of refrigerator maintenance and the chemicals helping to maintain it. We seem to so commonly take a refrigerator for granted, as it stores and maintains our food. It isn't something I would normally consider when considering high contributions to climate change, past that of maybe it always being on and draining energy. Often really focusing on the food we put in, rather than what is holding it. I feel that it'll be interesting to see how current refrigerators are phased out and recycled on a mass scale. As well as if a consumer campaign must take place.

<p>
I think “Project Drawdown” and the 25 solutions have the right idea in mind. I had no idea that refrigerator and air conditioners produce such a large amount of greenhouse gasses. By reading this, I have become more aware of different solutions that could be implemented. Many I cannot do myself due to my position, but I would fully support someone who can and would do them. Personally, I can make a difference by watching my diet and becoming more educated. I really enjoyed this article because it showed me that there’s more that can be done other than switching to all solar and wind electricity. I think anyone who reads this would be intrigued by the large number of solutions and the amount of money that each solution returns. Many people refuse to change their lifestyles due to the economic impact, but Project Drawdown was able to show the numbers for each solution. There some solutions that I thought were extremely dangerous such as nuclear energy. I think that this shouldn’t be implemented due to the high risk and the amount of radioactive waste. We are trying to protect the earth so we can live on it, not to become sick due to the amount of radioactive material. This reading was very influential and I think that it should become more popularized.

I too was shocked by the most efficient way of limiting our greenhouse emissions was to address refrigerant management. Despite some of these solutions seeming too large scale and broad for one individual such as you or me to tackle I think that there are many things that we can do as individuals to support some of these solutions that Project Drawdown brings to our attention. I think that one of the most important actions we can take is to vote for politicians and propositions that support any of these solutions weather it relates to green energy like the installation of wind turbines and solar farms or food and land related issues like promoting sustainable agriculture through government incentive to follow practices like regenerative agriculture, conservation agriculture, tree intercropping, and others. In addition to voting we can take initiative and improve our own lives and limit our carbon footprint through wasting less food, changing our diet, installing rooftop solar on our homes to start. If one was serious about combating climate change and decreasing our global emissions, one could take up a job or work in a field that promotes these practices. As a kid of two parents who work in such jobs, one who works for a non-profit organization who works with supporting sustainable organic farmers across the nations while trying to combat large chemical companies like Monsanto and Bayer and the other who works in the solar industry I have seen first hand how many different paths there are to get involved with any of the solutions proposed by project drawdown. Although some of their solutions may be more effective than others, the sheer number of viable solutions to help reduce our total global greenhouse emissions gives me hope that it is not too late to act and shows me how many different angles we can take when attacking the problem of climate change in our society today.


<br><hr>
Mekenzie Hagman I enjoy reading these solutions as well. Since I have not acquired much information about how serious our planet is suffering due to the climate crisis, I cannot simply predict or consider solutions to this problem. However, Project Drawdown provides a clear and effective list of solutions that people can actually carry out. The statistics and data are accurately stated and calculated, which shows the convincing facts.

I agree with your comment on this reading. I am not surprised that air conditioning generates the most greenhouse gases. Although an air conditioner does not emit black smoke, it is constantly producing greenhouse gases as it functions, and releasing them to the environment. In summer, we often found the weather unbearable. To make ourselves more comfortable, we will turn on the air conditioning to cool the house down. However, at the same time, it is emitting greenhouse gases to the environment. This will end up a vicious cycle which leads to a rise in global temperature and trying to make ourselves cooler through using air-conditioning. In my opinion, it is difficult for us to cope with the unbearable weather. However, we can still reduce the use of air conditioning by leaving the house and spending our day in the shopping mall or library. When we get more people in one area, it will be better than switching on the air conditioner in every single house. By eliminating the use of air conditioners in the day, it will be better for the environment while we can all enjoy the comfort air-conditioner brings to us.

I was really surprised how refrigerant management was is the number 1 thing we can do to reduce atmospheric CO2 reduction, and it is concerning considering how if our planet is warming, there will be more demand for them. A viable solution like the ammonium or propane substitutes will be needed to address this surprisingly huge greenhouse gas emitter, as well as effective communication and awareness of the problems posed by air conditioning and refrigerators. Besides refrigerant management, I found it really encouraging how implementing the proposals in the summary of solutions actually lead to savings in the billions and trillions of US dollars. 
                               <br><br>


What I found most appealing and awakening is the way we handle our food and land use. I believe that in order for us to solve the climate crisis, a huge overhaul of our relationship to the earth and nature is in order. Under our current agricultural and food systems, it is really gross and disturbing how we are mistreating the land and animals on our planet. Why do this when we can be living in harmony with the earth? Mother Nature clearly has its own cycle of ecological interconnectedness and harmony figured out, and all we have to do is play and be in that cycle as well, and abundance and beauty will flourish. Solutions like intercropping and silvopasture are practices that will help curb CO2 emissions, create a more diverse and beautiful environment with more animals and plants coexisting, and create more profit for farmers and those overlooking them. 

                               <br><br>

I find the solutions from Project Drawdown very promising and hopeful for our world, as they are not only practical for our world, but will also truly make it a more peaceful, diverse, clean, and beautiful place.

I am also shocked that the top 1 solution is refrigerant management. Actually, I didn't realize the fact that using refrigerant harms our environment so dramatically just as I didn't know how much CO2 will be emitted during breeding cattle. The methods that I am familiar with don't have so much influences on protecting environment, such as turning of LED light. In that case, I have to say that schools and Governments should pay more attention to teaching the effective methods so that children will have a deeper understanding about climate crisis, and most importantly, they will have the idea about how to solve this problem. After reading the top 25 solutions in "Project Drawdown", I found many practical ways to reduce the amount of CO2 we emitted. For example, don't waste food. It is a simple but efficient approach to save the Earth. However, many are failed to do so. The amount of the annual food waste is a surprisingly large number. Imagine if everyone of us try to only buy and cook the food on the right amount, the combination result will be extraordinarily large. It will have a large impact on temperature rising if the total food waste cut to only a half. Moreover, I agree with you that the nature already given us the sophisticated ecological cycle so that there is no need to create a new one, which is wildly arrogant action and already causes terrible outcomes. Thus, changing the agriculture  style is imperative.

I really enjoyed this week’s reading because it offered MANY solutions for someone to take in order to reduce their carbon footprint. I think the average person is sort of turned off when they hear about crazy life changes such as giving their car up or not flying anymore which results in them not trying to find other ways in which they can help the climate. This article, however, suggests numerous options for an individual who doesn’t think they can give away their car or stop flying. One idea that really caught my attention was number 8 which was on photovoltaic (PV) panels. The part about this that interested me the most was the amount of money to be saved in this investment. As I was watching the presidential debates this last week, it seems as though not one candidate could escape the question of “how are you going to pay for that?” “where is the money for that going to come from?” After reading that the installation of the PV panels could account for $81 billion in savings when compared to fossil fuel plants, I couldn’t help but think that people have it all wrong. Saving the climate won’t cost us a lot of money; in the long run, it will save us billions! (And that amount doesn’t even factor in the amount of money saved that will come from natural disasters (such as the paradise fire) happening less, resulting in spending less on climate damages.
                                <br><br>
Another part of the reading that I liked was number four which was a plant-rich diet. I gave up eating meat almost a year ago and it feels good looking back and thinking of how my carbon footprint has been just a little bit tinier. I was shocked reading that “According to a 2016 study, business-as-usual emissions could be reduced by as much as 70 percent through adopting a vegan diet and 63 percent for a vegetarian diet, which includes cheese, milk, and eggs. $1 trillion in annual health-care costs and lost productivity would be saved.” Reading that emissions would be reduced by 70% was mind-blowing, especially when you think about each person doing this.

I agree with many of the points that you made throughout your comment, and found them really interesting. When we first began the class all we were learning about was the damage that we have done, however in this week's reading we finally learn about what we can actually do now that we have caused all of this damage. Knowing that we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint by merely altering our diet, and wasting less food on a day to day basis was encouraging, because I believe that we are all capable of easily making that change. Perhaps, it is because I have been vegetarian for most of my life that I believe that this change is so simple, but I have many friends that have switched over to a vegetarian or vegan diet and haven't gone back. While some may claim that there are important nutrients that we need that we can easily get from meat, such as protein, they fail to recognize that there are many vegan and vegetarian foods that also provide our bodies with the same nutrients as meat, but with a significantly smaller carbon footprint. As you pointed out in your comment, these solutions won't be costing us a lot of money, which was what I was worried about every time we talked about the things that we needed to do to reduce our carbon footprint, but as I went through the 25 solutions I was shocked to find out that all of these solutions were actually saving us thousands of dollars. If we were to waste less food, not only would we be reducing our carbon footprint, but we would also be saving ourselves a lot more money. This also reminded me of how we would save so much money if we were to give up our cars and start to use public transportation more, because we would not be spending hundreds of dollars a month on the payment of the car, gas, and maintenance. We all need to do our part and make some sacrifices so that we can save our planet.

In Ken’s lecture video he says that the rollback green house is emissions is by eliminating hydrofluorocarbons which are in refrigerant and in conditioning systems. This is the number one thing that we can change in order to help the planet. This sounds so amazing until you stop and think, what about our food where will we keep it to have it fresh for whenever we use it. Yea we could buy groceries daily so you don’t have to use a refrigerator but then that requires a car because we realistically can’t ride a bike and carry all of our groceries home. Companies could start to make everything in cans and put a  bunch of preservatives to make them last longer but there are things that you can’t really put in a can. Do you start to see where there might be a problem? Eliminating hydrofluorocarbons can really change the way that we as humans impact the world but what are some more alternatives that we could start to implement into our daily lives to help reduce hydrofluorocarbons, other that not turning on your air conditioner, start drinking room temperature water instead of having a machine that cools your water? What are some alternatives that we can use to replace a refrigerator?

These simple fixes all seem relatively quite easy such as reducing our food waste or cutting back on our meat eating ways. Or even raising livestock in a more sustainable way would counteract the methane outputs, for example such as silvopasture or implementing renergative agriculture. I think that’s why I'm quite frustrated when it comes to our selfishness about the environment. The two ideas mentioned above are quite easy to incorporate into our own lives and both happen to be about food. But we only had to read 25 ideas that could dramatically lower our carbon outputs in the upcoming years, and they aren’t that relatively difficult to implement. Some of the ideas talked about should be implemented either way such as educating girls worldwide, it shouldn’t be something that we start doing just because our earth is in danger. I worry that some of these issues are just now being talked about which is good because they’re getting attention, but on the other hand we shouldn’t have been ignoring them in the first place. Our consuming habits and our selfishness has led us to become desperate and now we’re scraping together anything and everything we can to fix the problem we started. I think it’s just stressful knowing that we have such a limited time to fix everything wrong with our environment and it’s all on the future generations to solve the climate crisis.

Hey Alyssa! I too feel the stress of being in such a critical time regarding climate change. However, in my reading of Project Drawdown's "Summary of Solutions," I felt some of that stress lifted, because the 25 top points that it lays out are very practical and seem largely easy to implement. For example,  switching to a plant-rich diet, the #4 solution on the list, is something every could do today, and according to Project Drawdown, usual food emissions reductions were "63 percent with a vegetarian diet." If many people did make this switch, that would provide a major reduction in harmful emissions, and even save approximately "$1 trillion in annual health-care costs" as stated by Project Drawdown.

                                <br><br>

While a switch to a totally vegan or vegetarian diet is seemingly ideal for the environment, I also think that for those who want to eat meat, practices such as  silvopasture and regenerative agriculture would allow them to do so much more sustainably. In specific, the practice of silvopasture was one that I had not heard of before, but considering it mostly involves integrating trees into livestock pastures seems relatively easy for ranchers to implement and even better, Project Drawdown says that it can sequester "five to ten times as much carbon" as pastures without tree and also helps to minimize the methane emissions of livestock.  Overall, I hope that education around practice such as silvepasture and regenerative agriculture continues, and that their implementation will help those who still want to eat meat to do so in a much more earth-friendly way.

After reading the Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming I wondered how many companies would actually follow this plan and apply the suggestions into their day to day business. I was pleased to do this reading this week because the suggestions were straightforward and simple. A few examples would be managing diets, reform farming strategies, use only conservative agriculture methods and manage grazing. Family planning and educating girls is especially close to my heart. I had always believed in fair education for all especially in countries in which education for girls is not seen as important. I am glad there is now statistical data that supports this movement. Overall, I found the readings to be insightful and very informative. When I move out of the college dorms and into my own place in the future I will make sure to live in a smaller square place area, shop and consume less, eat a healthy green based diet and use mainly public transportation. I am very thankful for this class because it has been so eye opening for me, I only wish the American public were taught this on a daily basis.

I agree, this reading was so incredibly refreshing. I loved to hear about all these feasible, cost-effective solutions. Organizations like these bring hope to the general public. Although I'm thoroughly disappointed that most companies won't adapt these policies and most politicians won't push legislation to enforce them, I do have so much hope. Young people are coming of age and we're becoming so aware of this glaring problem. Politicians are, slowly but surely, turning towards this problem and towards solutions. The lobbyists can't keep us silent forever. The government needs people to govern, and we won't be alive if everything continues business as usual. The most important thing is scientists coming up with real, tangible solutions and the desire of consumers to buy from sustainable, ethical cooperations like R.E.I. The more people who understand the impact of buying less and buying well, the more will turn away from large companies that continue to betray the Earth.

When doing the reading, it was both unsettling but comforting that there are so many things that are affecting the climate crisis. It was unsettling to know that there are many, many things that have taken a great toll on the climate. Especially major aspects that play a huge role in our daily lives, so it would be harder to be able to manage. However, it was also comforting to know that even though there are many issues, there are possible and effective solutions that can be done to help the crisis. It was a bit surprising to see things like women education and refrigeration, etc. towards the top of the list. To know that some solutions are in a sense so simple, however so hard due to people’s beliefs, it sucks to know. This reading also allowed for a hopeful future to be presented which was a nice change from the sucky future that has been an image from past readings. A big issue that is present throughout these issues is those of major companies or policies that are in place that stop these solutions from occurring more rapidly.

I agree with you. It's crazy to see how many things in our everyday lives play a part towards the climate crisis we are facing today. Some of the things contributing to this are new to me that I probably would've never known if it wasn't for the reading Ken assigned to us. Although there were many issues, I like that they gave us alternatives and/or solutions that would be beneficial to our planet. 
                                <br><br>
Ken's emphasis on which politicians we choose to elect is extremely important. There are several politicians who support and fund programs which increase carbon production. Many people who seem to vote for politicians with these same views tend to be older, aka people who are called "boomers." On the contrary, the new generation is focused on moving forward to a healthier and more habitable planet, which is why many of us are on Bernie's side. It would be a shame to see our country be put in the wrong hands TWICE in a row...

I honestly feel that the “Project Drawdown solutions” have been the most insightful readings I have read in this class to help the planet to date. They give solutions to problems we have been hearing about all of this quarter as well as put it in a way that makes it actually seem obtainable. I also like the fact that it brings up less known problems that I have not even heard of, such as how bad for the environment the refrigerants HFCs are. I also like how it brings up some solutions that I have known about but have not seen in class, such as the almost catch 22 of nuclear power. The fact that it also shows how much CO2 will be taken out of the atmosphere, how much money it would cost to implement, and then how much it would save by having implemented one of these solutions is also important. I think that part of the problem of  trying to encourage people to change is that they may not want to because they do not see the total benefit of what they are doing. These solutions show how they will be benefiting themselves as well as the planet. I think these are the types of strategies that will convince people the quickest, because if people see the direct impact, they may be more willing to agree with it.

I completely agree! Reading these solutions was one of the only times in this class that I felt there are ways out of this crisis. The fact that there are 100 solutions laid out for all of us to understand and implement gave me hope for the future. I was incredibly surprised to see refrigerant management as the number one solution, but reading the description and impact discussing gave me clarity on why HFCs have such a big impact on our atmosphere. There were other solutions that I've never even thought of, such as silvopasture. That seems like such a minimal change in farms, but the benefits to our planet are overwhelming. I also appreciated that they out calculated costs and savings. I feel as though that shows that it would immediately cost quite a bit of money to implement these changes, but the overall savings would be much larger. Also, it's hard to put a price tag on our planet, but that might just have to be done to show people that we are in a crisis, and we need to do something about it. Some of these changes are on a larger scale and need to be changed through policy and political action, but many of them are also personal choices that make a huge difference (refrigerants, eating a plant-based diet, reducing food waste, etc). If there are numerical values behind these solutions, then hopefully people will take serious action.


<br><hr>
Hi! I definitely agree I think this reading was very insightful especially considering I had never heard of many of these solutions. For example, I found the # 1 solution REFRIGERANT MANAGEMENT really interesting to read about. This was also one of the solutions I have not heard about which seems crazy considering it is the number one solution.





<br><hr>

I also liked how this weeks reading was laid out. I have been trying to convince some of my friends as well as both of my parents that there are so many things we can be doing to fix this crisis. They usually believe me, but will not take action of their own, such as trying to explain that we should cut out plastic water bottles and try being vegetarian just once a week. I believe that I can show them this article and convince them to vote the right people into office to help our planet and make changed in favor of this article. There were things I knew such as family planning and plant based diets, but I also had no clue about offshore wind turbines or silvopasture. I also believe that maybe if people see how much we can actually change, it will be efficient and impactful.

Reading the Drawdown List was incredibly interesting. This “roadmap”, as Ken puts it, is an invaluable resource to help us align our priorities when considering how to fight the climate crisis. It puts all the information in one place, abundant with plenty of details, to help people understand the real impact of actions and practices on the planet. Reading through the list, I was surprised to learn about the impacts of refrigerants, tropical forests, solar farms, and silvopastures that I was completely unaware of. By highlighting these sources of carbon dioxide, we can see that there is more to do than just using less water or replacing our lights to LEDs. It is really surprising that these topics are not advertised by environmental groups more frequently.
                                 <br><br>
However, I did have one issue while reading this list. Although it is useful to see the carbon footprint of practices, listing these practices by that descriptor alone fails to acknowledge the environmental impact that these practices can have. For example, installing solar farms is #8 on this list, despite their potential to devastate ecosystems. Solar farms can cause the loss of habitat, and even life, of plants and animals, deeply affecting the ecosystem of an area. For this reason, I don’t think that it would be responsible to rely on this list as a sole resource for making changes to our society.

I agree with your argument that we should not rely solely on Project Drawdown when deciding which changes we must make in order to combat climate change. However, I think this list is a very comprehensive starting point that is definitely an advantage to have. The solar farms were one example of a potentially devastating change, but there are more on the list that the scientists addressed. 
                                 <br><br>


Number 20 on the list was a solution I have become very familiar with in the past year, nuclear. The scientists do well to list the negatives to this particular solution and even refer to it as a “regrets solution”. The many meltdowns and destroyed ecosystems of the past have currently overshadowed all the good that nuclear could potentially provide for the world if harvested correctly and safely. Specifically, the scientists point out that had our world shifted to a nuclear energy society, 16.1 gigatons of carbon emissions would be avoided, which is a lot compared to the amount of carbon burning coal puts into the atmosphere. Because of this, I believe that the writers were trying to establish a guideline rather than a concrete list of solutions with this project.


<br><Hr>
I agree that reading the Project Drawdown solutions list was very interesting because it truly is a concise “roadmap” of what issues our society should focus on in order to reduce our carbon footprint, starting with the top three things that we can all do to reduce our individual carbon emissions:
                                 <br><br>
Stop overuse of Transportation, specifically automobiles
                                 <br><br>
Downsize Housing, specifically larger homes
                                 <br><br>
Reduce our over-production of food
                                 <br><br>
I find it astonishing that, by addressing these 3 things, one can reduce their carbon emissions by half or even more. I also really appreciate the format of the list (the list first exists as a simple list with little to no information next to it, but then, if you click on a specific solution on the list, it takes you to a new page with plenty of information), since that made it so much more easier to read through (it doesn’t start off as an overload of information).
                                 <br><br>

I wonder why the real carbon-emitter culprits are not really talked about. I think the reason may be because companies still want to make a profit even though we are going through a climate crisis. So, they choose to emphasize items like “electric cars” to consumers as ways to reduce the consumers carbon emissions and consumers just go along with it because nobody is really taking it upon themselves to educate the public about the major carbon-emitters. 
                                 <br><br>

I’m glad that you brought up the issue with solar farming because I think that the fact that solar farming can negatively affect animal habitats is something that not alot of people know about. This is something that I really care about because we as humans have already destroyed so many ecosystems and we need to really try to drastically reduce our destructive habits. Also, eating a more plant based diet and reducing food waste are both long-term goals of mine. I think feminists and climate change activists need to work together to try and educate more women, since it benefits women, obviously, but will also benefit the movement to curb climate change.

After reading possible solutions for reducing climate change, I was surprised by some of the more effective methods. For instance, I did not expect refrigerant management to be near the top of the list. This is due to me not taking into consideration how every refrigerator and air conditioner releases heat because I was not aware of how they necessarily cooled the air. I appreciated the format of the website because it was easy to see the most to least impactful solutions.  These revelations demonstrate how we cannot solely rely on the word to be spread around by the media or common communication but rather we have to look into the problem to see what are viable impactful solutions. However, I was overwhelmed by the numbers and figures since I am not accustomed to their meanings nor can I fully grasp what the number signifies. For example, I was confused as to how the numbers can vary that greatly between scenario one and scenario two. Since the difference between the scenarios is whether to stop climate change from increasing 1.5 C or 2 C, I do not understand how the emissions from the solutions change. Overall, the website is helpful to understand the overarching type of changes that we need to make in order to slow down or even stop climate change.

When I was a junior in high school the discussion of how much aerosols and refrigerants affected climate change had surprised me. But thinking about it there's more that we don't know and at times all this knowledge can become overbearing as there is so much someone needs to consider when it comes to what contributes to climate change. The website is a great tool in helping break down things in an easier format that could be understood easier. The media doesn't express all this information so we need to look to each other and have more conversations about all this on a bigger scale. It's great that with Ken's class these discussions are happening and more people are starting to see beyond the basics of the Earth is getting warmer, but why it's happening and who is contributing to the problem and also how the government plays a role as well. Seeing the intricacy in the system is mindblowing and something I don't fully comprehend. On the other hand, the solutions were great and I do like the idea of bioplastics as it would contribute to less waste (plastic makes up for so much waste).

Project Drawdown was not only very interesting to read, but also rather inspiring.  So many of the proposed changes to mitigate the climate crisis from this class so far have frankly left me feeling ambivalent about our societies ability to actually adopt the necessary changes.  But to see actual list of the most important changes needing to be made, along with how easy or logical some of them sound, is inspiring.  It put it into terms I can understand, a checklist of the most essential problems our world collectively needs to take action on first, along with how to do them.  What stuck out to me a lot was the number 1 item in the list, refrigeration management (although I SWEAR I read the rest of them as well Ken).  It stuck out to me because it seemed like something we could totally manage to do, because well, we've done it before.  In the end of the 20th century CFC's were burning a hole in our ozone layer, a problem that was much more visible at the time as it went faster than the overall climate crisis and luckily did not have a denial movement like we do today (that I'm aware of).  And through the Montreal Protocol the worlds governments were able to tackle the issue together and get the ozone destroying chemicals out of things such as our refrigeration or hair spray products.  And the ozone layer has been coming back!  If it was that easy to fix the problem then, how much harder can it be to do the same now?  Of course refrigeration was only the number 1 thing on a very long list other necessary changes, but the fact that we have tackled and defeated such a problem before did give me some hope on doing it again in the future.

I have to say, reading Project Drawdown truly felt like a breath of fresh air. There was finally an article presented to me that walked the line between scientific and activist, and made me feel optimistic for the first time in a while.  I am surprised that I have never heard of Project Drawdown until today, but I am glad to have learned about this amazing resource. However, I do have some questions as to what is going to be done with the information presented. How are these stats and predictions going to be used? Who is using this data to actually create change? And how can I be a part of this change?  I am curious to learn about how accurate their predictions will turn out to be as well. Additionally, I was quite surprised to learn that the #1 most effective way to reduce emissions is through better refrigerant management and use of less CFCs. Because the media pays much more attention to glamorous ideas such as electric cars, or controversial ideas like fracking, many simple and sensible ways to reduce emissions are overlooked by the public. While these solutions are not overlooked by scientists, there must be public support and momentum to create legislative change, and it is hard to achieve this if these solutions are overlooked by "flashier" solutions. Project Drawdown was a very interesting read, and I am excited for the discussion on this in class. I find it amazing how certain solutions I believed to be most important didn't even make it into the top 25, and other solutions I hadn't even imagined were able to make top 10.

I, too, was very surprised to see refrigerant management as # 1 on the list. I was also pretty stunned by the fact that management and destruction of refrigerants could avoid emissions equivalent to 89.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide. It's amazing how the things you least expect could have the biggest impacts, both positive and negative. It's also interesting to find out the things we were told to believe really helped, like unplugging our chargers and switching to LED bulbs, are actually borderline insignificant in comparison to taking the bus or eating less meat. Project Drawdown  really put things in perspective for me in terms of where our focus should be and how much these changes could benefit the world.

Just like you, this was the first article we’ve read thus far that has left me feeling optimistic. Although all of the projects cost a lot of money to make happen, not only will all of them generate a whole lot more money than what it cost, but even if it didn’t, I believe the climate crisis doesn’t have a cost. We shouldn’t be worried about how much it’s gonna take to find solutions, because in the end, the price won’t matter. The goal isn’t to make profit, but rather to save the planet. I also hadn’t heard of the Project Drawdown before this class, which honestly surprises me because it seems to be such a useful resource and something everyone should be turning to. Why hasn’t this plan been publicized? Why aren’t countries using these ideas to make change? Why isn’t it being integrated? Some of the solutions are very technologically savvy and are going to take years to develop and completely integrate into society. That being said, some should have been integrated so long ago, whether or not the climate crisis was even a problem. Educating girls worldwide and providing accessible birth control and family planning shouldn’t be something we’re doing just because climate change is becoming an urgent problem, but rather just because it’s the right thing to do and should’ve been done so long ago. A lot of the solutions presented should be obvious answers and shouldn’t have been ignored in the first place. I too was very surprised that the most effective way to reduce emissions is through reducing and producing better chemical refrigerants. No one is talking about this and instead we are creating so much hype around other, more innovative solutions, such as electric cars, which didn’t even make the list and, as we’ve seen, aren’t even that good for the planet. All in all, I really hope these solutions are put into place sooner rather than later, and I also hope reading the impact statements inspire people to switch to some of the more attainable, individual solutions, such as reducing food waste, implementing solar panels, eating a mostly plant-based diet, and practicing family planning.

This was a really good reading for Hiltner to give his students because it provides them with a basis of the exact solutions to the crisis we are in. I was aware of many of these, like wind farms and solar energy. However, this summary provided me with the differences between onshore wind farms and offshore wind farms. It also explained the further advantages of concentrated solar energy as compared to rooftop solar energy. Concentrated solar energy uses solar radiation as fuel of steam turbines and makes heat before it makes electricity. Heat is much easier to store; therefore concentrated solar energy can produce electricity far after the sun goes down. I found this to be very cool and interesting. I also learned of many initiatives that I had no knowledge of previously. For example, typical cooking stoves release pollution liable for millions of premature deaths each year, drive deforestation, and emit greenhouse gases. This is terrible, but new technologies do exist (such as the biomass stove, which forces the gases and smoke back into the stove’s flame). I am glad I was asked to read these 25 summaries because I truly learned a lot.

I agree with you that this reading was very effective and insightful. This reading outlined many simple changes we can make in our everyday lives that will have pretty significant impacts on our climate footprint. While many of these small changes may not have as drastic of an effect as relying on public transportation and flying less, they at least are doing something. I don't think that our approach to mitigating our current crisis needs to be all or nothing. I do not think that is feasible, and it may work for a small amount of time, but we are destined to fail really quickly. It needs to be a slow process that increases with time. Not all citizens are ready or able to give up their personal cars, but everybody can change to LED lighting, put a larger emphasis on recycling, and try to reduce water by installing low flow shower heads and toilets.

What I also liked about this website is that it provided many small solutions on many different scales. There were solutions that could be obtained by households, businesses, large corporations, and even our nation as a whole. If everyone adopted just one of these solutions, the cumulative impact could be pretty substantial. It makes me feel more optimistic about mitigating this crisis when I see how many small things we can easily do to make an impact.

A few notable things from the “Summary of Solutions” is how HFCs refrigerator solves the problem of ozone depletion but has the capacity 1000-9000 to warm the atmosphere than CO2. A few more things are to invest more in wind energy, as it generates profits over time. In addition, it’s crucial to improve food distribution, storage in less developed countries, and teaches consumption in more developed places. A few more things are to educate girls. This leads to more life expectancy, better life for society.

Along with the author of this comment, I also thought it was notable how large of a problem refrigerators are to the climate change we are experiencing. I thought it was very random, but it makes sense as every single household does have a refrigerator which has the ability to release emissions 1000-9000x more potent than carbon dioxide. When I saw that we were reading a list I was also slightly confused, but it makes sense and it compacts a lot of information into 25 short paragraphs. 
                                 <br><br>
Another strategy that really stuck out to me was reduced food waste. Food waste is a huge contributor to our waste on this planet, with so many resources used to produce it, and so many resources used to dispose of it after. After watching “Cowspiracy”, I also now know how impactful beef is on the planet. It uses so many resources and if we just waste it, it literally throws it all away. 
                                 <br><br>
Educating girls is also very important, and I really think more countries should try to apply this. With more educated girls, there would be less accidental births, and instead more people to try to combat the climate change we are experiencing. This is a win win situation, because girls are more educated, and the climate also improves. This piece of writing should be circulated around more because these things aren’t hard for governments and people to do, and also has a lot of information that people should know.

I enjoyed this reading because like Ken said, this is what we have been asking for all quarter. We wanted to know what we could do, so Project Dropdown gives us 100 things. Reading the first 25, many of them were things that had to be done collectively rather than personally. I think that is what sums up the climate crisis. Changing a light bulb will not suffice as many people once thought. We have to waste less food and change our diets. We have to take care of the soil in order to keep the carbon dioxide in it. This list gave me more insight into what is necessary to do as a whole. Although I could do the minuscule acts like changing light bulbs and turning off lights, it is necessary for ALL of us to do it and more. Although most of the list included things I have never heard of, reading into them was very interesting because these are things that we could do. We have the tools and solutions, we just need more people in it by bringing more attention to it. If a student is barely learning about these solutions, we need to get these solutions to the general public as well.

I very much agree with what you say. Concrete solutions is the perfect way to prevent people form chickening out with excuses like: "I don't know were I should start" and "Yeah, but I don't think I would really make an impact". Although I understand some of these complaints they are not going to save our planet, the time for action is now. I noticed that you mentioned a lot of the solutions being collective. For me this is where a problem starts to form. Collective solutions need to be carried out by the people in power because they usually have the resources and authority to decide if such large projects are going to happen. But as noted earlier in the course the people in power are not exactly the people who have climate change high on their list of important issues. Thus I would propose deriving a list form Project Drawdown with a more individual nature. The same solutions will still  be in place but it will be a more individual guide. This way people feel like they have control over their behaviour and are able to make an impact, hence making the idea of changing more doable and desirable.


<br><hr>
I agree that awareness should be a big focus. The only time I've ever heard about some of these suggested solutions and their impacts have been in this class and in my AP Environmental Science class in high school. This information isn't very mainstream with the public, so there's not that much pressure for leaders in, for example, the agricultural industry, to incorporate more sustainable ways of growing livestock and crops as mentioned in the Project Drawdown reading. The consequences of HFC use in refrigerants is also just something that the public doesn't really know that much about. It's important for the people to become more aware of the main causers of our dying planet so that we can put some pressure on ourselves and leaders who can make the changes.

It is difficult to think of this list as a “roadmap of how to globally reduce out greenhouse gas emissions”, as Ken says, because I am unfamiliar with many of the things on this list. Before reading this article, I did not know what some of the terms such as “silvopasture” or “afforestation” meant, let alone knew how they could help reduce greenhouse gases. Now that I have read Project Drawdown’s description of these ideas, and analysis on how they could impact the world in the future, I am still puzzled as to how I can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions with silvopasture or afforestation. I think that companies such as Project Drawdown are great in informing the public about the truths behind what needs to be done in order to slow down climate change. However, as I am just one person, and even our class is just 1,000 people, and us as a whole cannot implement Project Drawdown’s strategies by ourselves in order to have a big enough impact on the earth to actually change something. This is simply due to lack of access to many of the things, and reaching a small demographic of people who will, in reality, probably choose not to do any of this. I think an article about how we as individuals can cut back on climate change, as Ken has led us to before with transportation, food, housing, children, etcetera, would have been more beneficial to this class. There were some ideas in Project Drawdown’s article that could relate to the individual, such as reducing food waste, eating a plant based diet, and family planning. As students, and future leaders in this world, ideas like this are more beneficial to us than the more specific ones such as silvopasture and afforestation.

I really agree with this comment. When taking notes, I found myself looking up what different words meant. How am I supposed to help reduce something when I don't even know what it is? I found Project Drawdown's article very informative, but I also wish it was more accessible to students. I already eat a plant-based diet, have attempted to wast less (mainly by reducing my online shopping addiction), and thankfully am on birth control so will not be contributing to the 250 million unplanned pregnancies a year, but I am very reliant on my car. For work I dog-sit, which requires me to drive to people's houses that are sometimes in remote locations. I know a lot of my car use is purely out of convenience, but as a full time student I am usually forced to pick the least time consuming option. I hope corporations as a whole will follow the items on the list, as mentioned in Ken's video, even doing just the top three combined can reduce more emissions than the other 75 items on the list. Just not sure about how much I can contribute to that.


<br><Hr>

I'm glad you agree with my comment. I too could make the effort to rely more on public transportation. Similarly to you, I work random hours and am frequently in a rush so it is extremely convenient to be able to use my car. Yes, some better time management would easily solve this problem but, as a full time student who typically gets minimal hours of sleep at night, I need all the extra time I can get. Maybe we can carpool together sometime?



<br><hr>
I understand what Jessica claims about using her car out of convenience. I use my car to drive to work, the grocery store, a friends house, or anywhere else I need to go that is outside of the UCSB campus and Isla Vista. I know that living so closely to my school definitely reduces my emissions because I am able to bike to class every day, and not use my car for that. However, I know that I could cut down on my driving by using public transit, such as the SBMTD that is free for UCSb students. The MTD could take me to the grocery store or a friend’s house, but I do not think I could compromise on driving to work. When I am driving to work, it is usually early and I am usually in a rush. I can be ‘late’ to the grocery store, but I cannot be late to work every day if the bus happens to fail me. So yes, I understand and relate to Jessica’s use of her car for convenience.

This week's reading may be my favorite reading so far. Not only was it very easy to read, but it was in a way uplifting. After reading just a few of the summaries I felt much more optimistic about our generation overcoming the climate crisis. Sure, I understand that it is going to take drastic systematic change, but an article like this is keeping us headed in the right direction. I would recommend this to anyone one of my friends who is interested in reducing their carbon footprint or just want to lead a more environmentally friendly life. This detailed account of solutions to what seems to be an unbeatable challenge in our society today was a very enjoyable read. 
                                 <br><br>
Out of all of the solutions we had to read, the most interesting to me were “Plant-Rich Diet” and “Educating Women”. The first one, explaining the benefits of switching to a plant-rich or even plant-based diet, reassured my interest in making the switch for my own personal diet. As a student here at UCSB, as I have mentioned in a couple of my comments before, I am overall becoming way more conscious of what I put into my body and of ways to reduce my carbon footprint. The most obvious reason to switch to in my opinion is, “Plant-rich diets reduce emissions and also tend to be healthier, leading to lower rates of chronic disease.”  I think that as a student athlete it is very important to be aware of the benefits and more importantly consequences of the food that you eat and switching to a plant-rich diet has helped immensely. It is obviously a plus that switching will also contribute to reducing GHG emissions. In fact, the article states, “If 50 percent of the world’s population restricts their diet to a healthy 2,500 calories per day and reduces meat consumption overall, we estimate at least 26.7 gigatons of emissions could be avoided from dietary change alone.” If this isn’t inspiring, I don't know what is.
                                 <br><br>
I also found the sixth solution, “Educating Girls”, very interesting. I remember, in the beginning of the course, that Ken mentioned the importance of educating young women and family planning. When I first heard this I wanted to learn more about how educating women could be beneficial to our fight against the climate crisis. This article explained to me that two solutions, family size and global population, are critical to the climate crisis and they can be executed through the education of women and specifically family planning. It goes into further detail and states, “Women with more years of education have fewer and healthier children, and actively manage their reproductive health.” Education plays a huge part in the development of the lives of young girls, women, and their families. What we learn in school will set us up for our future and it is important that we are learning about reproductive health, the steps to finding a good job, and how to face the impacts of climate change. In conclusion, the best part about this week's reading, is that this article included a grand total of 80 solutions to climate change. I gladly went through and read more than the required reading and I suggest everyone does too.

I also was incredibly glad that we are finally reading something that is uplifting and has not just a few solutions to the climate crisis but 80 suggestions for us to consider. While it was important for us to get some background with the readings in past weeks about what the climate crisis is, what emissions are doing to the planet, and how we got ourselves into the sticky situation, I am happy that we have arrived at the solutions phase. As you mentioned, it is still going to require quite a bit of systematic change for us to make a reasonable difference, but with an actual plan laid out the challenge seems slightly less daunting. Before Ken assigned this reading I had no idea that there was such a well researched and informative list of solutions out there for everyone to access so easily. As you mentioned, everyone should read this, so I hope that everyone in this class is able to share the article with at least one person in their lives because that would be a good start to educating more people. 
                                 <br><br>


The idea of being able to help our planet just by educating girls around the world is really amazing, so it is no wonder that this solution is sixth on the list. So many of us, myself included, take our education for granted because we cannot imagine a world in which we were denied what we see as such a basic right. The article states that 62 million girls around the world are unable to get the education that they deserve whether it is due to economic, cultural, or safety-related barriers. Pretty much everyone knows who Malala Yousafzai is, and I feel like her story can heavily relate to how women are willing to do whatever it takes to get an education. No one should be put in the position that Malala was put in, so if we want to educate more women, policy around the world is essential. If more women are educated this leads them to be more responsible with the care of our planet and more responsible with the care of their own health. This care for their own health will lead to less unplanned pregnancies and will therefore combat the environmental issue of overpopulation. Educated women are such a powerful force and if we are able to provide more women with a safe environment to learn this will lead to more innovation all around the world. So many women have contributed to the scientific findings surrounding climate change, such as Eunice Foote and Rachel Carson just to name a couple, so it is incredibly important that we encourage girls to value their education and make their voice heard. 
                                 <br><br>


I also found the fourth solution to be quite thought provoking because increasingly plant-based diets are becoming more common and encouraged. Your comment about a plant based diet being good for student athletes reminded me of a film called “The Game Changers,” which follows the story of several different professional athletes that became much stronger competitors once they changed to a plant based diet. This is a good approach to take when encouraging people to change their diets because some people may not decide to change for environmental reasons but will do so for health reasons, and no matter the reason this change will make a significant difference in our climate. As we have seen again and again meat consumption is a huge issue that stems from a deeply ingrained cultural idea that eating large quantities of meat is indicative of success. When people go to high end restaurants it is not shocking to see them eating a large slab of steak or some other meat dish as they completely ignore that this is causing one-fifth of global emissions. I am not guilt-free when it comes to eating completely meat free but I have never been someone to eat red meat and I am working to cut chicken, the only meat in my diet, out of the picture. We should all work together to keep one another accountable when it comes to our diets because this will without a doubt improve our personal health and the health of our planet.

<br><hr>
I have the same feeling as you about this reading because it is specific, direct, and easy to read along because of those statistical numbers. Before reading this article, I feel like our course contents are more based on saying than acting and it kinds of confuses me when Ken just orally describes the possible solutions and undertakings that we should or can do. However, having this article makes things easier to follow and understand. For example, I enjoy the description of the top one solution which is refrigerant management not only because it accounts for the most reduction in CO2 emissions but I also see the progress that we have made since 1987's Montreal Protocol. I clearly see that we have the idea and dream of solving the problems in refrigerant and we certainly did it step by step. From the time we discover CFCs to the time we have problems with HFCs, we have made respective changes and solutions. And this is why we would enjoy the inspiring data and stories now. This article definitely cheers me up with respect to the changes we have discussed along this quarter and I believe that we will keep working and contributing to more reduction in CO2 and leave a better world for future generations.

The topic of educating girls as well as family planning stood out to me too. Global population growth is a tricky problem to try and systematically solve. We have obviously seen tactics like the One Child Policy be unsuccessful, and I have wondered what a successful plan would look like. I know many people who want large families, so I have wondered how we could stall population growth without restricting the number of children that families can have. I think what makes the solution of educating girls and empowering them with birth control so appealing is that there is no problem of having to restrict anyone. In fact, this solution is all about freeing women of restrictions! Hearing this solution makes me hopeful because it is both great for women and the planet! I see absolutely no downside to the strategy of educating more girls and helping them have access to birth control and family planning. It was shocking to read that 45% of US pregnancies are unplanned, and this is where birth control is much more available to women than other countries. This is why it is important that we push for birth control to be readily available to all women. When a women gets to choose when she has children, her whole family benefits by only supporting children that they were financially and emotionally ready to support, children benefit by being put into adoption and foster care programs less, and the whole world benefits from the population growing at a slower rate. It is important to vote to get people who are pro-choice into office because someone who is pro-choice chooses women and chooses the planet!

I too found Project Drawdown’s summary of solutions to be extremely effective in informing people both about the climate crisis and viable solutions to combat it. It was overall uplifting to learn about them, especially because of the “impact” sections that provide statistics that show that these solutions would make a tangible impact. I also enjoyed how the list is both informative yet concise and easy to understand, making it a great source to share with others who do not know much about the climate crisis but still want to learn how to help. 

                                 <br><br>

As I read through the list, it is easy to see how many of these solutions are interconnected. For example, family planning and educating girls go hand in hand. Not only is this a huge social issue, but its success would also have beneficial effects on the environment. By educating girls, they are more likely to engage in family planning and thus slow population growth. With less people to feed and house, a copious amount of resources will be saved because women are able to make educated decisions. Adopting a plant-rich diet is also tied to many other solutions in the food sector, such as managed grazing and farmland restoration, largely because it would reduce the need for livestock in the first place. By first decreasing our desire for meat, our land can be used in a more environmentally-conscious way.

I heavily agree with the fact that this read is more enjoyable than most of the material we have been given in the class as of now. Short, simple, easy read into understanding the things we need to do to not only stop the rising of emissions, but have a chance to actually LOWER the emissions. This reading was definitely an optimistic one, even though it gave us some heavily statistics and information, it didn't give off the "looming" idea that the world is doomed because of us. This reading just simply gave us information and enlightened us on how doing these simple things, both in a personal and collective standpoint, to help our planet and gave a sense of "This is manageable! Do not fear, this will help if we look at it on a different lens!". And I definitely believe that this way of sharing the news to public is more acceptable by the public than just an alarmist standpoint like Wallace-Wells.

                                 <br><br>

And I felt the same way when being told that "educating girls" will help the environment! I was honestly completely shocked that this was a major cause in the rise of greenhouse gases. But while reading the article, it made more sense. More uneducated girls = more unplanned pregnancies = more growth in population = more carbon emissions, and the cycle continues. Education does help girls to learn about themselves and what they can to, see the other options out there instead of being an uneducated housewife with unplanned pregnancies. Women need learn about not only what they have, but what they are WORTH. And if education helps both women AND the planet, then I don't see why this CAN'T be a priority! This reading is definitely worth sharing to the public, simple, easy, and more optimistic than most material directed towards the same issues on climate change.




<br><hr>
This reading was also my favorite because we are finally focusing on what we can do to fix the climate crisis instead of yet another reason why we are totally screwed.  In this way it made it a much more fun and enjoyable read for me.  I was also intrigued by the majority of the information that was on Project Drawdown.  First off I was confused why refrigerators were at the top and to my recollection we have not talked about them once in class.  The reasoning they gave for refrigerator being the number one cause made since and probably since not many people are informed about it makes it that much more of an issue.  Something that I was completely off about was solar farms and their importance.  I was expecting them to up around the top 5 but it is all the way at number 10.  My idea was that a natural way to get electricity for electric powered cars houses etc. would be a huge help in reducing green house gas emissions into the atmosphere.  Like you mentioned I also found " Educating Girls" to be a interesting topic.  I thought at first that the fact that women have less kids when they are more educated meant that the smarter a women the more they realize that having children is an idiotic idea.  After reading the page that is not the case.  It is because "Educated girls realize higher wages and greater upward mobility, contributing to economic growth. Their rates of maternal mortality drop, as do mortality rates of their babies. They are less likely to marry as children or against their will. They have lower incidence of HIV/AIDS and malaria. Their agricultural plots are more productive and their families better nourished."  Overall I as happy as you that is read was more enjoyable and am looking for to future readings that can tell us more on how to reduce our daily emissions.

“If cattle were their own nation, they would be the world's third largest emitter of greenhouse gases.” What a mind boggling number. It blows me away on a couple levels, but the most fundamental being the realization that diet is such a large player in the game of climate change. The idea of eating my way into extinction is about as embarrassing as it gets! Switching to a plant based diet not only would help me steer clear of my personal extinction (avoiding the negative side effects of eating endless stacks of assorted meat) but help the world keep away from impending doom from a heating climate. 
                                 <br><br>

I also find this particularly relevant to life as a citizen when compared to the other items in the list. Personally, I can’t afford a windmill, I don’t have a house to put solar panels on, I don’t own cows to feed in trees, but I do eat. By eating, I can make a difference by choosing to eat plant based meals, the same way we should all choose to do.

After reading a various amount of solutions that are implemented towards Climate change, I am very inspired, yet I am very impressed by their creativity and ability to look at the problem from a different angle. When we usually talk about what there could be do about climate change, we usually think about daily habits like methods of transportation, reducing water waste or changing up food diet. These unique solutions really opened a whole new door to me and allowed me to draw connections between other world issues and climate issues that seemingly don't exist. Out of all, I have two solutions that I found pretty interesting.
                                 <br><br>

While reading about reducing food waste, I was only thinking about the food we throw away in restaurants or dining commons, but I wasn’t aware of the fact that food is being discarded before they reach the consumers, and this can happen in any of the processes -- supply chain, storage, etc.. I learned how this problem is not the same in different countries based on their economic powers. And it was quite a shocker to me that food waste accounts for 8% of global carbon emission.
                                 <br><br>

On the other hand, I didn’t expect education in Women would have ties to climate change. Apparently according to the article, higher education in women is correlated with healthier children, better reproductive health and, most importantly, less offspring. It is obvious the less children we have, the better we can help fight climate change. Moreover, greater education provides their family greater social mobility, and offers a better future for their offspring. Overall, this is a cost effective method for countries that struggle with sustainability.

I thought it was really interesting that the top things I think of regarding the climate crisis were not on here. Like Ken said you always think of switching your lightbulb but that is not in the top ones. I also was shocked how much harm the top 25 caused more than the bottom 25. There were some things I had never even heard of before. For example geothermal energy. I did not know you could go into the earth's core and receive energy that way. While this seems really cool I also think it seems quite terrifying because it can cause mini earthquakes. Another topic I did not know a lot about were peatlands. I had no idea they are only 3% of the world's land mass but take up almost as much carbon as the oceans and more than any forests. I thought this was very crazy. 
                                  <br><br>
Another thing I found interesting were the different forms of agriculture and land use. As Ken mentioned 11 of the top 25 involve land use so there is a lot we can change. One I found intriguing was Silvo Pastures which take up 5 to 10X more carbon than pastures without these trees. I thought this reading was really helpful to see all the solutions in one place. Till this point in the course I knew some changes I could make but I like to see them all spelled out in one place like here. I also like how easy it is to make a huge difference through our diet. To switch to plant based can cause such an amazing impact. Through this course I have constantly been thinking twice about my diet choices and going towards more plant based.

I totally agree regarding the fact that I found it so interesting that most of the top 25 solutions I read we never even talked about and I never even thought would have such a big impact. I remember learning about CFCs and how the Montreal Protocol banned the use of CFCs in high school, but I never knew there was another part to it with HFCs. More than that, I never knew how big of an impact they are having on our environment and the world in general. I think the fact that most people (myself included) don’t see these issues as big and needing of solutions is very dangerous because we continue perpetuating the increase of global greenhouse gases emitted due to our ignorance and lack of education when it comes to these dangerous issues. Another big thing that popped out for me was how big on an impact subsidies have on the US livestock industry. If our government stopped giving this industry subsidies, the price of meat would increase and less people would buy meat constantly. As Ken mentioned before, if we even lower our meat consumption by a factor, this will have a great impact on our earth. And once people eat meat less, they will see they can incorporate other plant foods into their diet that are just as healthy and tasty. 

                                  <br><br>

I also found it really interesting to see how the top 3 solutions given on Project Drawdown have a bigger impact than the bottom 75 in terms of lowering greenhouse gas emissions. If we just put in our energy and actions towards fixing these issues through lobbying to our government and using our voices for positive change then we can fix these issues and make a big and positive impact on our environment. Also, the fact that 11 of the 25 top solutions listed were based on land use truly shows how we can use our land in a way to take in more carbon into the ground rather than have it being emitted into the atmosphere.

                                  <br><br>

I found this reading very eye-opening because I never realized how important different and more renewable energy use is for our environment and how there are so many big solutions that most Americans and people worldwide don’t know about. For instance, educating girls seems so obvious to most Americans, but worldwide many girls in developing countries are forced into bad situations because of the lack of education they receive. This important and necessary solution can help in so many ways.



<br><hr>

I agree with your comment. I was also very shocked to hear that doing things like switching your lightbulb to LED had very little impact. I find it very worrisome that most of the list by Project Drawdown were things that I have never heard of or considered before. Many of the solutions of this list were things that I didn't even know existed such as peatlands and silvopasture. I feel that this is mainly what companies motives are. They are convincing people that they are having a major positive impact on the environment, but they are not. I feel that this tricks consumers into thinking they are having a positive impact and therefore can be more harmful in other areas of carbon emissions. Throughout this entire course, I have learned things I did not know before. After reading this article, I felt the same way I did after watching "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion". I felt more knowledgeable. When watching last week's video, I had no idea that fast fashion businesses make these big claims that are not fully true. I was left in shock. After reading part of Project Drawdown's list, I was shocked at all the things that would majorly and positively impact the earth. When reading the "Impact Statements" I was also in shock because many of these have great benefits. They will all cost a lot but it seemed as though most of them had profit and benefits in the long run. I also found the reading very interesting because it provides solutions. I feel that solutions are very important to be provided in every writing discussing climate change because it would not be very effective for someone to just write that climate change is an issue and needs to be prevented and not provide any ways to prevent it. This would lead to the reader disregarding the reading altogether. Lastly, I agree that it is good that a big positive impact can come from our food choices. Many of the solutions on the list would be immensely difficult for just one person to do, but a change in one's diet would not be.

I know! It is so shocking to see a list of 25 top solutions that sound very foreign in the terms of sustainability. I knew a lot about CFCs too but was also forign to HFCs. I thought we had found a solution but I had no idea we had another problem. I think that education is something our society needs to do inorder to see change happen. The huge companies creating these products are very successful at pretending their product is a “solution” when in reality it is causing tremendous harm. I find it very difficult to see how huge of a role money plays in our society. At times I forget that money controls everything. Like you mentioned with the livestock industry. We cannot get away from it if the government continues to fund it and not being more plant based. 
                                  <br><br>

These proportions like you mentioned are very crazy. That a small number of solutions outweigh numerous solutions. The issue here falls back on education once again. If society was educated on these issues and was able to see the impact there could be change. Not only must this education for everyone, it must be given with proof and guidance that no one will contradict it. This is where we constantly run into issues. The huge companies who produce these products are also arguing that the impact is not as large, resulting in disbelief and conflict. I agree that educating females should be spread to other developing countries as well. I think this could have a huge impact on the knowledge women have and reducing population size.

It is so hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that changes I have been making, have not been having as large of an impact as I would’ve hoped. It was odd reading the list and hearing solutions that seemed foreign for me as well. I agree the issue here is with companies motives. It is so easy to trick a consumer who wants to be more sustainable. This is because huge companies may lie, or provide a better solution, but still not the best so that they can continue to profit. I agree that after reading this I felt a lot more knowledgeable. I was very happy that there is a huge list of solutions, even if I had never heard of them till reading this. I agree that the cost may seem high at first, but the revenue over time was more than double in every single example. This is where I get lost. If companies can profit off of this new and sustainable technique, why do they refuse to do it? I agree that many of these solutions would be very hard for a person like you or I to change our farming techniques, because we do not have a farm. But it is not difficult for either of us to change the things we purchase. By supporting products that support the solutions presented, we can make a huge difference.

After reading this piece, I feel pretty conflicted with being satisfied with the way the information is presented and happy with a lot of the solutions but really discontent with the sections about women and girls. I think it is not okay to single out women and girls in saying they are a contribution to the climate crisis due to family size and planning. It takes two to tango and men are just as responsible for population growth. It is not up to women solely to become educated while men continue to push for what they want and make the woman be the one to stand up and say something against it. Especially in the educating girls section where it was talking about educating women so that they are more likely to not marry young or against their will…? How would that help if they are being forced into something because of the constructs of society? If it is against their will, educating them alone will not help the situation considering they clearly have no say in it… hence the against their will part. Educate men instead to not force women into doing these things in the first place. I think a better way to present this solution would be to discuss the general population growth issue to everyone because like i said before it takes more than just the woman to have a baby. 
                                   <br><br>

Aside from that negative side to the reading, I think that the rest is extremely helpful, especially with the statistics outlined next to every solution. Simply stating a solution without explaining the actual effects of it is much less effective. Connecting the dots between the statistical reduction in CO2 emissions to a particular, attainable solution will help people start with the things they are comfortable doing and know what kind of an impact they are making and will hopefully move up the line. Additionally, the connection between the net cost and net savings i think is really important for us to be able to see. Some people may feel like making certain changes has an effect on their financial status or the economy but seeing all the numbers put together helps even the playing field and show that it will be ok to make these changes.

I completely understand that the way the information is presented seems as if women are being blamed for having kids and should be educated so that they don't make 'such a bad decision'. I think that was a major shortcoming by the author, but on the other hand there is real evidence that correlates the education of women with lower birth rates. I think the correct way to portray this phenomenon is by emphasizing it gives women the freedom to do what they want, by giving them the tools to achieve those goals through education rather than the slightly accusatory tone the reading takes.


<br><Hr>
I completely agree with your comment. As I approached the summary titled "educating girls," I was largely confused as to why they would seemingly pin the issue of overpopulation on women/girls. Although it makes sense (albeit only a bit) that birth rates would slowly decline if BOTH men and women remained preoccupied with studies, women cannot be solely blamed for having children when it takes two to conceive. In addition to this, there have been an overwhelming amount of cases where women are sexually assaulted, so even if they were 'educated,' the situation still remains out of their control. It is true that there should also be a section dedicated to educating us men to keep it in our pants and to use contraception when planning to engage in sexual activities. I would bet that out of the 25 million unplanned pregnancies, men are primarily to blame for lack of preparation/control. 
                                   <br><br>

However, aside from that section of the reading, I would also agree that Project Drawdown is very helpful and has a lot of valuable information to give. For example, I had no idea the use of hydrofluorocarbons in refrigerants (which are used for refrigeration or A/C units) have a 1,000 to 9,000 times greater capacity to warm the atmosphere than CO2 alone. By containing 87% of these refrigerants, we are looking to avoid emissions equivalent to 89.7 gigatons of CO2. Also, before reading these summaries I was vaguely aware that reducing food waste and committing to plant-based diets would help reduce emissions, but I was certainly unaware to the extent of which they would. It's kind of crazy how reducing food waste by just 50% can avoid emissions equal to 26.2 gigatons of CO2. Similarly, if 50% of the world's population were to restrict their diets to 2,500 calories per day and overall reduce meat consumption, 26.7 gigatons of emissions could be avoided. Overall the statistics, net costs, and savings calculated in Project Drawdown help make the benefits of implementing and practicing these solutions much more clear.

After reading these strategies and solutions to deal with climate crisis and high greenhouse gas emissions, I feel optimistic and
hopeful. In the previous reading, I learned how severe the issue is and what dramatic effects it will bring to the earth. These arouse my concern and worry about the climate and our planet since it seems to be unsolvable.

As Ken mentioned in the video, these solutions are global and collective. Among these solutions provided, I think that most of them are feasible and workable and in fact, some of them are adapted already, like wind turbines and solar panels. Most of these solutions are beneficial to both sides because they could largely reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases, mitigating climate change, and some of them, like rooftop solar panels, are affordable and help eliminate poverty. The overall top three solutions mentioned by Ken is a reduction in food waste, education among girls and women, and efficiency of land use. For me, I believe these three strategies are realistic and practicable since the education of girls and women is a worldwide issue that many people fight for this and food waste, or change to the plant-rich diet could be achieved in our daily life. Moreover, Ken proposes three personal strategies that people could apply to help mitigate the issue and reduce the personal release of greenhouse gases: getting rid of your car, living in efficient housing, and eating a plant-based diet. I think these approaches are appealing and beneficial not only to the environment but also to ourselves.

Hi, Yuning - I feel the same way! This was probably the only reading I have done for this class that hasn't made me feel frustrated or upset, it actually made me feel encouraged now that we are learning about some global and collective solutions to mitigate the climate crisis. I agree that most of the proposed solutions are pretty feasible, such as adding more wind turbines, solar panels and creating less food waste. However, I am still doubtful about probably the most important ones on the list -- such as adopting a plant-based diet. The reason I think these two will be the hardest to implement is because they will cause a lot of resistance not only politically, but culturally. It is widely known that American culture is a heavily meat loving society. But many other cultures rely on meat as their primary protein source as well, making this a very difficult shift to make. Personally, I was raised in a Mexican household where "carne asada" (grilled meat) and "pozole" (pork stew) are the go-to celebration meals. While I have been interested in adopting a vegetarian diet for a few years, one of my largest barriers was that my family was highly in control of the food I ate in high school. Even now in college, I have started to shift towards a plant-based vegetarian diet, but I find it hard to cut meat entirely considering the food options in the dining commons. It is going to take large-scale policy changes in the US to decrease meat consumption, which will probably have the most impact of these solutions. I think something like the carbon tax for foods like meat will have an extraordinary impact in resolving this problem, unfortunately I'm not so sure how easy it would be to pass a tax like this.

In my opinion, this was the most important reading we have had in this class so far. It was incredibly inspiring to read that there are many proven ways that we can mitigate the climate crisis. I found it so interesting to read about solutions that I had never even heard of before. One of these is silvopasture, in which trees and pastures exist in the same area, having the potential to reduce carbon emissions by 31.2 gigatons. This solution seems viable because it still allows for meat production, which many people have a hard time even considering giving up, while still significantly cutting down on global emissions. The other solution that caught my eye was increasing women’s education around the world. This is such an important topic because it fights against unjust gender equality while simultaneously reducing the impact our species is having on the planet. It’s a brilliant double whammy that many people would love to get involved in. 
                                   <br><br>

Overall, I think showing this list to more and more people is extremely important. If we can push our lawmakers to enact the changes outlined in Project Drawdown we would be benefitting our planet enormously. In my eyes, plans like this provide much more hope than simply pushing people to use reusable water bottles and change their lightbulbs like many activists do. These changes have proven, wide-scale impacts and could dramatically alter the course of history.

I feel the same way. Many people can acknowledge that change needs to happen in many areas of human behavior, but it's often hard to pinpoint viable and researched solutions. This reading made it clear that there are a number of reasonable ways to change one's carbon footprint. However, reading these short summaries made me realize that the real thing getting in the way of slowing the climate crisis is human ignorance and greed. It's not that there is no solution in sight, it's that people are not willing to change their behavior, maybe lose some money, but still create change. I think while the issue of women's education is important for many reasons, like you mention, it's going to be hard to change cultural practices of certain areas. Because of this, it's important to start with who we can control: ourselves. Like Ken mentioned, one of the main ways we can limit our individual carbon footprint is to waste way less food. That can take the form of buying less groceries and simply eating everything on your plate during meals. Changing mass human behavior is possible, but it is a longer journey.

I agree that this was the most important reading we have done in class thus far.  It truly emphasized the fact that there are actually exact solutions to this severe problem.  Judging by the previous weeks, it seemed as though there was hardly any hope in mitigating this issue and its effects.  However, after watching this video, I am glad this class is finally showing us a more optimistic side to the climate crisis and showing us a direct "road map" about how to mitigate the crisis in a timely manner.  Furthermore, I would agree with your opinion that the issue of women's education is a notable factor in both solving the climate crisis issue and fighting gender inequalities.  Prior to taking this class, I would have never thought that educating women was one of the biggest things we can do to lessen the effects of the climate crisis.  I am glad that I am now aware of this extremely important solution to both the environment and the future of women.  I think in order for more people to become aware about the awful effects of the climate crisis, it is important to show them concrete solutions to this issue.

You're right, without people urging their local law makers and politician for change nothing at a larger scale will change. Thus, we, as the coming of age generation, should utilize our political power to urge such measures pertaining to do with issues that effect us.
                                   <br><br>
In my case I was surprised to find the issue of women's education on this extensive plan, not because I've never heard of such proposition-I'm all for it-, but because you don't see this issues taken up by all climate change measures. Which is stupid because this issue directly effects us as human beings and it should be recognized as a basic human right (Why should gender constitute the right to become educated? Because the systems at play and the patriarchy has established it so. We've been knew.) I love how the project also specifies that this plan is not the rich countries telling the poor countries to not have children because historically speaking racist ideologies have been in discussions for reproductive rights. Instead this plan is looking to honor the dignities of women and children which is great because it is essentially tackling the right to reproductive justice, healthcare, and the overall well-being of women and hopefully approaching this with intersectionality.
                                   <br><br>
In regards to your first point about the article being the most important so far, I don't think it's fair to say the past articles were not important because the point of reading all these "pessimistic" stories about the human condition and the climate condition were not to become depressed or disillusioned but to use as a driving force to make a difference no matter how small.  But, I also don't believe you were trying to belittle the articles on purpose.




<br><hr>
I also think this reading is the most important one comparing to others. From the beginning of the class, we mainly studied that the climate crisis is true and is very urgent to be solved. We know the fact now, but we don't know how to help. It is meaningless to acknowledge something without any reflection. And as students with limited knowledge, we are actually confused about how to contribute our effort in an effective way. With this reading, everyone knows their proper method to solve the climate issue. I was quite astonished that making the change in our food ranks such high on the list, which means that we can make our effort to the climate crisis by changing our own living habits. In addition, the electricity generation sector also can help a lot with the climate issue.  This is the part that governments and big companies can do for solving the climate crisis.
                                   <br><br>
Overall, I think everyone can find their comfortable way to contribute their effort to the climate crisis through the list.






<br><hr>
I also found this to be one of the most important readings we have had so far! Throughout this course I feel like every week one of the most common comments we see other students asking Ken is "when are we going to learn about things that we can do to help?" and even though this reading isn't as simple as "do this" or "do that" it gives us a better idea of a more "road map" to bigger changes we can make in society. As you mentioned, and Ken talked about above, the education for women globally paired with resources to aid in family planning are crucial in helping the prevention of our own kinds impact against the planet. It was really unfortunate to read that 45% of all pregnancies are unplanned and over 225 million women in lower income countries who want the choice whether to get pregnant or not lack the contraception to do so. I really had no idea that the lack of education for women is as detrimental as is it for our planet. I really enjoyed reading through these projects recommended by Project Drawdown, because like you said, these changes have been proven to have wide-scale impacts and are hopefully able to be successfully implemented. Even though these changes would be extremely beneficial to our world and the future of our planet, the likelihood they are put into effect are actually fairly slim. Our truth is that our world right now is living in a sad space run by corporations and greed, even if we have ability to help other people doesn't mean that we will.

For my feminist studies class, we were tasked with writing a paper on a global issue that disproportionately affects women. I wrote about climate change. Many of my classmates were surprised, as when one thinks of women's rights, they often do not see it as tying into the climate crisis, but two issues are incredibly interlinked. When disaster strikes in less affluent areas, women are not able to cope as well as men. Take Hurricane Maria for example. After the Hurricane, the lights in Puerto Rico were our for over 100 days, this made the streets much less safe and led to an increase in 911 calls regarding domestic violence. Women are also tasked with many of the household duties: cooking, cleaning, and taking care of children. When a woman is tasked with this, she is also tasked with finding water for her family, clean water. This was not easy during the 2017 hurricane season. Many women spent hours lugging water back and forth. Women in less affluent countries will undoubtedly suffer the most because of climate change. I enjoyed this reading because it highlighted something that has not been brought up in this class. Educating women is not only a social good, but it helps the environment in unexpected ways. There are literally no down falls to this, but it is incredibly difficult to change cultural standards.

In the video, Ken said there are two ways of addressing climate change problems; one personal and one collective global. Firstly, let’s start with a personal way. Getting rid of driving, living in efficient housing, wasting less food and eating a larger plant-based diet, consuming less stuff, and having fewer children. By doing all of these, we are likely to cut our carbon footprints in half and maybe more. These are strategies we can achieve on a personal level. In our reading assignment, Project Drawdown purposes a comprehensive plan to reverse global warming which includes the top 100 most effective solutions to global warming. What’s surprising is that educating girls ranked among the top 25. Before reading this, I can’t think about what educating girls has to do with global warming. Educating girls can avoid emissions by curbing population growth. Women with higher education have fewer and healthier children. They have a lower incidence of HIV/AIDS and malaria. However, today, there are 62 million girls around the world who are impeded from getting an education. This project also mentions some key strategies to change this situation. Project Drawdown also proposes ways of approaching this problem from electricity generation, food, land use, and materials perspectives. As Ken said, if we could achieve these suggested solutions, we can significantly reduce our greenhouse emissions.

After I read the Project Drawdown, I was astonished by how many methods it provides for us to revert the anthropogenic climate change, and it offers a bunch of detailed approaches for us, and it gives us any possible things that we can easily do in our life. “The operational costs of refrigerant leak avoidance and destruction are high, resulting in a projected net cost of $903 billion by 2050,” mentioned in the article. This is the point I would never know if I didn’t read this article. From my own opinion, while we choosing the what several methods are the most effective to reduce climate change, I think the most important part is to start from what we can do in our daily life, and then add up day by day, and then change our mindset, like acting like a environmentally friendly person, wasting less food, and eat more plant food instead of meat.  Another aspect of the reading that shocked me was the cooking stove section, as I had never thought about this as being detrimental to our planet. I had never heard of a biomass stove, but after reading just a couple sentences about them in this reading I am curious to why they aren’t widely popular.

I like to think of myself as being pretty well educated on the climate crisis and solutions, but the top 25 solutions in this reading made me realize how little I actually know. I usually just think about things like our eating and buying habits as key issues to address, I have honestly never even heard of silvopasture before. Unlike most of the reading in this class, this one actually made me more hopeful that we might be able to make a real difference in the environment. One of the things that made me most optimistic was the amount of solutions that actually save money. Climate deniers love to argue against climate action by asking how we will pay for it, but in reality, things like wind turbines, regenerative agriculture, and solar power pay for themselves.

I also felt very surprised reading "Project Drawdown". So many creative solutions to combat climate change. I was particularly taken back by all the solutions related to food. I would never have expected that so many of the 100 most substantive solutions to global warming would be food based. "Project Drawdown" makes me hopeful for the future. For so long, this class has listed the problems and dreadful predictions of global warming, but finally, these solutions propose actually achievable goals. The website is also very concise and easy to read. A quick skim through the solutions can leave, even the most uninterested person, well informed. I feel like agreements, accords, and peace treaties are all thrown around in the topic of combating global warming, but not enough is said about the actual plans, the details, the nitty-gritty.

·      Once I finished reading the first 25 solutions in Project Drawdown I think it is incredibly unfortunate that we have not implemented these changes yet because not only are they better for the environment bit they can also help save money. A lot of the tings on the list are easy changes like educating girls, reducing food waste, and family planning. The other things on this list specifically the ones addressing land use are really important to reduce emissions. Like Professor Hiltner said people have been asking for a “roadmap” of ways to help climate change, and here it is. If we start implementing these things we can reduce our footprints on earth immensely. I do realize that these changes are never as easy as they sound on paper, but in the long run taking a hit now to save our future is worth it. I do feel hopeful for the future though knowing that these options are out there and possible to do. I also feel more educated on all of these different options we have out there. I have known about these solutions listed, but I honestly had not known much about them, so I am glad Professor Hiltner had us read these. This website has done a great job at explaining all of these solutions, in a quick and easy to understand way.

I agree that the website did a great job at explaining all the top solutions in a way that's easy to process. The way Project Drawdown ranked all their solutions in a chart that compared the cost and emission reduction made each method easy to compare. The first thing that stood out to me on the summary of solutions was the fact that wind turbines came second on the rankings, reducing a total of 84.6 GT in terms of carbon emissions, and it would save a grand total of around 7 thousand billion US dollars. In fact, going down the list, there were only three solutions that cost more than it would save. So if going green is also more economical, then there is no reason that the government wouldn’t invest more time into delving deeper into these solutions. Of course, as you said, although the solutions sound pleasing, things are never as simple as they seem on paper. For example, one of the reasons these changes haven’t been implemented is probably because of greedy corporations like the Heartland Institutions that use their power and affluence to influence legislators who can make a difference.


<br><hr>
I agree, this reading was very simple and straightforward. The solutions are right there listed for you to read as well as giving you the impact of what would happen if these solutions were implemented. I had previously heard about the damage CFCs and HCFCs refrigerators do to the ozone layer but I had no idea that it would be listed as the number one solution. And seeing how food waste was ranked at number three in the solutions was also surprising, even though it probably shouldn't be. Seeing the format of this reading made me feel better because I could easily see what I could do in my personal life that can help reduce waste and my carbon footprint. I definitely enjoyed reading this because it does not seem like such drastic steps, at least not the ones on the very top. I can see myself coming back and reading them again so I can recommend these steps to a friend or family member.

After many weeks of reading articles on how human activity has destroyed the planet, we finally get answers on how to fix climate change, this list is much more realistic than telling people to give up their cars or to stop travelling. In these 25 solutions to project Drawdown there is something everyone can do. You mention educating girls, reducing food waste, and family planning. I totally agree that we can all help to execute them. However, it is easier said than done. Especially in third world countries where women do not have the proper accessibility to these types of contraceptives. 45 percent of pregnancies are unintended in the United States, another 225 million women in lower-income countries say they want the ability whether and when to become pregnant, accessibility of contraceptive must be universal to all women we are not giving women the necessities they want/need.  “A third of the food raised or prepared does not make it from farm or factory to fork.” Some of it is unintentional where it occurs earlier in the supply chain where food spoils and rots during storage or distribution. What is unacceptable is that consumers reject food because it doesn’t look “perfect” meaning it has bumps, bruises, or coloring. Kenya, a developing country has made significant gains in education, educated girls/women lead to fewer and healthier children, lower HIV/AIDS incidents, and families are better nourished. Education is key

It felt good to read about some positive action that is being taken to protect the environment. After learning about how consequential the climate epidemic is week after week, I was not hopeful that we as a civilization could make it. However, this article made me feel secure. Knowing we have figured out which issues are most pressing, and how to we plan to mitigate these issues gives me confidence. I was surprised when I saw “Educating Girls” as a solution so high on the list. Educating women is not the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of ways to solve the climate crisis. However, after reading the summary, it makes sense. Educated women are more likely to have less kids, reducing emissions that would come with a larger population. Educated women would also be taught how to reduce their own carbon emissions and why it is important to do so, which helps spread awareness of the issue.

It is unfortunate to hear how terrible air travel is for the environment. Air travel is usually an unavoidable decision. You can’t drive across the Pacific if you want to get to Hawaii. And no one sailing to the hotel in Maui. In this, I see that the wealthy are getting blamed for this vice to the climate. But many middle-class and even lower-income people fly as well. Whether this is for business, family, or foreign travel, it is usually an unavoidable expense. I’m curious to see how we overcome this since we definitely cannot include flight in our carbon budgets. Will we be able to go to other countries we have to sail. Hopefully, we devise a monorail that gets us over to Europe in a couple of hours. I don’t know, but we definitely cannot keep air travel as it is today.

I agree that reading Drawdown made me more confident in humanity’s ability to stop climate change. The first thing I noticed was the variety of different solutions to help mitigate rising CO2 levels, starting with refrigerant management to education and family planning to clean cookstoves. I agree with Gina: when it comes to thinking of climate crisis solutions, I do not think about educating women at the top of the list. However, I do know that education is directly related to population stability: if a woman is educated, she is more likely to get a job and will have fewer children later. More humans means a bigger population which leads to more resource consumption.

One solution that I found particularly interesting and never heard of before was improved rice cultivation. I did not realize that rice production is a current contributor of methane: typically when thinking of methane and agriculture, the first thing that pops into my mind is cows. It was really interesting to look at all the different things we can do as a human population, and many more solutions exist than electric cars and solar panels.

What is quite astonishing from all this data is how our own Refrigerators/Air Conditioner , the ones in every single one of our own homes, are one of the bigger threats to our planet that lays silently from our own attention towards climate change as we primarily focus on the fossil fuel and tobacco industries. The fact that HFCs, which are the replacement for the original polluters in Refrigerators and A/C units, still carry the ability to warm the planet's atmosphere with about a 1000 to 9000 times greater capacity than the main suspect of climate change greenhouse gases, CO2. It's something we all look past because of the fact that Refrigerators provide the ability to prolong food we desire no matter what diet of choice you make and as a person from Southern California, the A/C is a god send when the summers reach over a 100 degrees Fahrenheit and made it bearable inside, but it's these benefits and major pros to our lives that makes us overlook the greater dangers these items possess as for myself, I never understand the great devastation they can leave us. The fact too that the initial solution to the Refrigerator/Air Conditioner as estimated by scientist, can reduce the global climate by 1 degree Fahrenheit, shows the immense presence on the climate crisis that these products have and how much following through the solution can be beneficial world wide.
                                    <br><br>
Alongside that, the other top three  such as off-shore wind turbines and a reduction in our food waste seem more manageable on an international scale as countries can fund turbines and promote waste reduction. We as a people produce more food (especially plant based) than we buy which in turn is wasted overall for the energy and nutrients put into making the food. In conjunction to a wider adoption of a plant based diet overall, would cooperate well with reducing the food waste left overall as there would be a wider and greater demand on the plant goods that would once lay waste. As for off shore turbines, these are already present in places in Europe, like the United Kingdom, and can be funded by other nations around the world like the United States, as there operations have already shown to be good overall. As in Southern California, down in Cabazon and Palm Springs, there is a ranging valley full of windmills that can produce 300 kilowatts of electricity individually which is equivalent to the power used in a single American Household a month. 
                                    <br><br>
In all honesty, each of these options aren't major lifestyle changes, with some that may be considered major, but each of them can have a major impact on the climate crisis. Let alone, the solution to the release of HFCs by Refrigerators and A/C units is stated to reduce the planet's temperature by 1 degree Fahrenheit. Imagine if we as an international community can do for the planet if we follow through with most of these? It would be immense in it's effect on the global climate and better for the world overall as long as if we follow through.

After reading the first 25 methods that we can reduce carbon emission, I feel hopeful about the seemingly unsolvable global warming. Three out of the top five ways of reducing carbon emission are approachable by common people. The reading indicates that using refrigerator and air conditioner will release fluorine and damage the ozone layer and generate large amount of fluorine-carbon compound to the atmosphere. We can reduce this by using air conditioner less often. Instead of turning on the air conditioner at home, we can simply go to public places such as cafes and shopping malls to spend the day. Public air cooling is relatively much more efficient than private air conditioning in our houses. In addition, reducing food waste and a plant-based diet are also things we can manage to do to reduce carbon emission. 
                                    <br><br>
What I found interesting about the reading material is it doesn’t just focus on direct carbon reduction, but also look at the problem from a human and social perspective. For example, I never know that educating girls could rank number 6 in the list, but it makes a lot of sense. The gender inequality is severe in most countries of the world, especially developing countries and third world countries. Putting effort and budget on educating girls allows them to have fewer but healthier children, which means they can use less energy but obtain higher economic productivity. Moreover, this would equip them with more resilience and greater capacity of facing climate crisis.

I too was struck by the inclusion of a few points of social change in this list of solutions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Ken discusses in the lecture for this reading that, by combining family planning and equal education for girls that will limit our global population to 9.7 billion people by 2050, we can reduce global emissions by a staggering 103 gigatons. These points make me consider that many of the problems we view through the perspective of the climate crisis overlap with social issues of inequality on a national and global scale. As a result, the cooperation of national governments is required to make change such as access to affordable education, distribution of contraception, and drop in maternal mortality. Even by wasting less food, which is #3 on this list, we can address the disparities between high- and low-income countries that do not have the equal access to many resources including food security in this case


<br><hr>
Yess!! I felt the exact same way I was so shocked but at the same time excited that there were so many things that could be done to help reduce the impact of greenhouse gases on the environment. From things like educating girls to regenerative agriculture, there are so many things that we can do as a population to help reduce the impact of global warming on the environment. With the rather disheartening tone of the “cowspiracy” documentary and all the other information we’ve gotten throughout this course, this was almost like a breath of fresh air. It was exciting to see that there were in fact so many things that we CAN do to decrease the impact of climate change rather than so many things that we CAN’T do because they impact the climate adversely. 
                                    <br><br>

After watching “Cowspiracy” but, as bad as it sounds, being a person that loves to eat meat, I was desperate to see if there’s any way at all that we can make agriculture more sustainable and better for the environment. Therefore, when I heard about Managed Grazing and how it can sequester from ½ to 3 tons of carbon per acre and 16.3 gigatons of CO2 by 2050. This could result in $735 billion in financial returns by 2050, on a $51 billion additional investment. As amazing as that sounds, this still doesn't address the methane emissions generated by cattle and thus I still need to reconsider my dietary choices. Another thing I read that really interested me was the project of farmland restoration, it amazed me that there are an estimated 950 million to 1.1 billion acres of deserted farmland around the world. Restoration can, therefore, mean the return of native vegetation, becomes a carbon sink, or the introduction of regenerative farming methods. This will have extraordinary impacts as it is projected that by 2050, 424 million acres could be restored, combined emissions impact of 14.1 gigatons of CO2. The financial return of $1.3 trillion over 3 decades on an investment of $72 billion, while producing an additional 9.5 billion tons of food. Another amazing thing we can do regarding this issue is conservation agriculture. This is when farmers till their fields to destroy weeds and fold in fertilizer, water in the freshly turned soil evaporates. Conservation adheres to 3 core principles: 1. Minimize soil disturbance, 2. Maintain soil cover, 3. Manage crop rotation. It sequesters a relatively small amount of carbon, average ½ ton per acre, but because it makes the land more resilient to climate-related events such as long droughts and heavy downpours, it is doubly valuable in a warming world. The impact of this analysis projects that the total area under conservation agriculture will continue growing from 177 million acres to peak at 1 billion acres by 2035. Reduced CO2 emissions by 17.4 gigatons based on average carbon sequestration rates of 0.15 to 0.25 tons of carbon per acre every year.

The top 25 Summary of Solutions to reducing global greenhouse gases was highly informative, possibly a little overwhelming, but also very impressive that there is a resource that consolidates all this wonderful data in an easily accessible way. I enjoyed reading about some solutions that I had never heard of before, like the advantages of Silvopastures (integrating trees and pasture for raising livestock), protecting lands like peatlands, and clean cookstoves! Some solutions almost seemed ironic that they had to be stated, but made completely valid sense, and also intertwined well with other solutions. For example, the idea of going back to Regenerative Agricultural practices like no tillage, no in-farm fertility (no external nutrients), no pesticides or synthetic fertilizers, etc., is not only healthy because we would go back to making organic products instead of GMOs, but would probably also cut down our agricultural production and reduce food waste. Since currently we are over-producing food anyways, producing less food would benefit our society. Other statistics that stood out to me was the fact that “heat energy contained below the earth’s surface is about 100 billion times more than current world energy consumption” (that’s crazy!) and how “Rice cultivation is responsible for at least 10% of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and 9-19% of global methane emissions” (which was disheartening because I love eating rice…). I also thought it was interesting that Project Drawdown mentioned Nuclear energy as Solution #20 because I think nuclear energy generally has a negative connotation. This could be something that Ken could address for us.



</p><hr>


<p>

Upon reading through the list of solutions, I noticed how the top solutions are ones not commonly heard. Reduced food waste is the #3 solution, yet like someone commented, we hear more about led light bulbs?? Not surprisingly, “up to 35 percent of food in high-income economies is thrown out by consumers, in low-income economies, however, relatively little is wasted at the household level.” At my job, so much food is thrown away, it literally sickens me. No one is allowed to take the food, nor is it donated, instead it's “defected.”  I almost feel like it’s my moral duty to take (steal?) the food, so it’s actually eaten, rather than wasted. Another even less heard-of solution is educating girls. The first time I heard that educating girls was a major solution for the climate crisis was in English 22. I was dumbfounded because I had never heard that, yet the explanation behind it is so logical. I think it’s disgusting how girls are simply expected to want children, and to fit a maternal role because of tradition or culture. Once my mom gave me a “when you have kids” lecture, to which i simply replied, “I don’t want children.” She acted like if I said something foolish, and though i know she didn't mean harm, it shows how deeply rooted sexism is in our culture. “When family planning focuses on healthcare provision and meeting women’s expressed needs, empowerment, equality, and well-being are the result; the benefits to the planet are side effects.” Knowing all that we know, there’s no excuse to not take initiative. Solutions like reducing food waste, and switching to a plant-based diet are quite literally in our hands, and we can make a difference starting now. We all know too much to ignore the problem any further, so anyone who isn’t choosing to help, is purposely contributing to the problem.

Well this reading was certainly a breath of fresh air. All quarter, Ken has bombarded us with facts about our planet slipping into crisis and corrupt politics that are only making the issue worse. It is encouraging to hear that we actually can make a significant change ourselves without necessarily having to involve those in power that are against the issue. I believe that all the tools that are necessary to make change starting now without politicians are there. They need to be used and implemented, and word needs to be spread about how these things are of substantial use to help climate change. But realistically, I’m not too sure that I like the odds of getting enough people educated and on board with all of these ideas to make a significant change. However, despite not being directly in charge of some of these for varying reasons such as the refrigeration units and nuclear power, most people can implement some of these changes like changing to a plant rich diet, educating women, and planning their families which will make some sort of impact on the environment, as opposed to none at all.

I, too, found this summary to be relaxing with the facts laid out of what we can do to address greenhouse emissions through solutions we haven’t already heard of. In addition to the 5 suggestions that Ken gave us (of which some were addressed in the article), more solutions we can take part of her are directly available for us to consider and input into our own lives. I found it uplifting to read about how organizations have already taken initiative to implement such changes, such as how in 2016, the Kigali Accord was established to phase out HFCs with natural refrigerants like propane and ammonium. With 170 countries contributing to such change sheds light on how policies can be enacted for the betterment of humankind, especially with this being at the top of the solutions list. I think the list itself gives applicable changes that can be utilized by both individuals, corporations, and governments in order to substantially reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions.
                                    <br><br>

The three solutions I see most immediately applicable to my lifestyle are food waste, plant rich diet, and family planning. With food waste, we can improve our handling of discards at the consumer level by composting or simply being more considerate of the amount that we have, limiting how much is eaten and then specifically what we buy. This leads to a plant-rich diet in which I can adjust my diet to exclude meat due to its large emission of methane from the food industry and not support foods that may not be organic.Not only does this have a better effect on the environment but is also better for myself on a physical level even though I admit this shift will be difficult at first. However, I have definitely been eating more vegetables and with more research into a healthy plant-based diet, such as considering my sources of protein rather than meat, I know I can make a healthy transition. Lastly, with family planning, I can definitely discuss with my family in the future by promoting a conversation around what was discussed by limiting how many children I may have.
                                    <br><br>

Overall, I believe this plan’s solutions are doable but is a matter of whether action is taken or not. Project Drawdown will not only affect our way of life, but ultimately the environment as we must consider our sources of energy, process of land-use, and more. All in all, I will strive to do my part through voting and making changes to my own lifestyle.

The solutions Project Drawdown offered were some of the most optimistic material we've seen so far in this class. The solutions offered seem very attainable and these slight changes can significantly impact our footprint. What stood out to me were the techniques related to agriculture and food production. Solutions such as tree intercropping or managed grazing seem to be very doable and offer promising contributions to sequestering carbon. The prospects of geothermal or wind turbines as increasing sources of energy is very promising. This gives me a more optimistic outlook as it seems mitigating the climate crisis is a more attainable possibility than we realize. It is a shame that some of these solutions have not already been implemented on a larger scale since they seem so manageable. If our most destructive contribution to the crisis is our diet choices, many of these solutions will not be enough, we will be taking two steps back for every one step forward. If we could expose more people to the impact of our choices, maybe we could see a larger shift to a more environmentally friendly diet.

I agree that these solutions are more encouraging than other materials we have seen in the past. However, whenever I clicked on a link to see the impact of each solution and the cost… it really scared me because who is going to invest in that? Are people willing to spend that much money on these solutions? I totally agree that these agriculture and food production methods seem so doable but why aren’t people implementing them? I’m just curious as to why farmers and manufacturers are still taking the traditional route. Perhaps, the monetary exchange. It will ultimately cost less if they do it the less environmentally friendly way. Geothermal was one of the solutions that really drew my attention because after discovering the source, it’s practically free. Why aren’t people all over that already? The issue here is having that first person to take initiative and take risk. We need more entrepreneurs that believe in the same thing we do. Lastly, what we could do right now is just to spread the word. Let more people know about the issue so more people could help!

I do agree that the items that were listed in order to combat climate change were some of the most optimistic viewpoints on climate change that we have seen within this class arguably the entire quarter. Not only does it list out the solutions that make it possible for the human race to combat the climate crisis that we are currently facing, but it also shows the steps along with the impacts that we can have when we take action. An example of this is the idea of the solution of educating more girls. This specifically addresses the topic that with more education that is placed, especially education that is geared more towards girls, can help prevent them from having unwanted children or attaining unwanted STI’s. They mention that over 45% of pregnancies are unexpected and that it is up to the institutions to create constructs that are more suited towards women. Suggestions that arise from that scenario is making sure that girls can overcome health barriers or that school is more affordable and accessible to girls. Women who receive higher education are less likely to have a lot of kids, and I think that says something about the decisions that they make as a person. 
                                    <br><br>


However, what I do not see that is optimistic to this, especially towards this topic specifically, is the fact that our institutions have not done anything to help girls receive this education. And this leads me to think about something during my political science class. In international relations, there is this notion of feminist critiques, one of which says that if women held more power or positions of decision making within international politics, there might be less war that occurs. This notion started to make me think about how the world would look if there were more women in power, especially women who continuously advocate for the empowerment of women. Yet, that reality just does not exist. Undoubtedly, we live in a world where men hold much of the positions of power, whether it be in business or politics, and this drives a lot of the decisions that are being made; we perceive men as being more powerful and capable of making tough choices and dealing with pressure. These are facts. But, the rulebook needs to change. 
                                    <br><br>


If we really want to combat climate change and create the initiative of education more women, it starts with the decision to do so in the first place. And that decision is only made when women can have their equity in our society; when they get their right at the table. Do I believe that the world would be dramatically different if women were to run the world? I’m not sure. I still think that people make good and bad decisions, and that is reflected in our international politics. But do I believe that women would advocate for more women if they had the chance to? Absolutely. Now, let’s give them the chance to fight for their right to receive education and make actual change. If we can do this, then we can combat climate change.




<br><hr>
I agree with you about how the solutions presented in this article were a lot more optimistic than any other material we have read or watched prior. I problem however I saw with a lot of the solutions was money, everything comes at a price, and I fear that some of those solutions might not be feasible as a result of not getting enough backing from people. I can see how food and  agriculture changes are within reach, but again more people just need to get behind it. I think that if enough  people in the agriculture industry started following those practices, it would spark a movement to work towards change.

I strongly felt that the Project Drawdown is a very helpful tool. It lists one hundred ways to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases from high to low. Most ways are the actions we can take now. I was surprised number one is the usage of air conditioner and refrigerator. Since I heard about they take a lot of energies to work, it is at the top rank of leaving carbon footprint. The following several methods are food waste, plant-rich diet, education and family planning. These are closed to people's life, which means even ordinary people can contribute a lot on reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. By presenting people the Project Drawdown list, people will have a better concept and they will understand how to reduce the emission of co2 in their daily life in a more efficient way. Project Drawdown is like a guide. It contains instructions which we can follow. I felt hopeful if we can start to take action on reducing the usage of air-conditioners and refrigerators, consume less meat and more vegetables, have better education, and have fewer children. These actions are simple but can help to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases a lot. If the Project Drawdown can be promoted to more people in more countries, the climate crisis would be greatly alleviated.

I completely agree with you that Project Drawdown is a useful and helpful tool. I think this is the first reading assigned to us by Ken that actually makes it easy for us to see exactly what we can do to help fight climate change by providing us with rankings of the solutions, as well as methodologies and impact summaries of each one. Although previous readings have mentioned solutions to the climate crisis before, none of them listed and ranked specific action plans and their effectiveness in an easy to read manner. Project Drawdown not only gives us the solutions, but it also gives us the estimated costs of each plan of action along with integration methods and potential results. For me, this made the solutions feel very real and impactful since I knew exactly what had to be done and what the projected results would be. I was also surprised that transportation was not in the top 25, since I feel like we've been learning that cars and planes left really big carbon footprints. In comparison, I don't think we've ever talked about refrigerants in class.


<br><hr>
I agree with you that the Summary of Solutions is a very helpful tool that provides a lot of good suggestions to help improve our environment. And most of the solutions are simple enough to  be made by normal people in daily life, such as carpooling or riding bikes to reduce carbon emissions by transportation. We cannot depend solely on the government to issue restrictions on the big corporations to stop pollution. Everyone needs to do something in order to save our own planet. And the Summary of Solutions offers people some very clear and easy ways to reach the goal of protecting the environment.

In the “Project Drawdown”, it is very encouraging to see the possible outcomes and solutions to save our planet. There were numerous solutions to help reduce the gas emissions from refrigerant management to retrofitting. When I was reading, it was very interesting and impactful how a simple action can impact and effect a major event or cause. I was shocked by the amount of unplanned pregnancies and how that can cause a lot of consequences and affecting the world. There are roughly 25 million unplanned pregnancies, and in the reading and the film it emphasizes the importance to educate young women to plan their parenthood and what other actions to take to control their bodies and also to learn more ways to prevent pregnancy when it is unplanned. In addition, it was interesting how girls attending school and getting an education can bring more of a positive effect to the world than depending on the husband and having kids. There is more to life than depending on a man . Women should have the same responsibility and have the same rights as men. I agree with how men and women should have the same opportunities to get an education and have the same life which can reduce the percentage and numbers of unplanned pregnancies. Because a lot of food is being wasted, this increases the gas emissions leading for the planet to be in worse and unhealthy conditions.
                                    <br><br>

In addition, the given solutions allow me to think more positively on saving and helping our planet. I know that anyone can make a difference and a simple change in someone’s life can make a dramatic difference as a whole. I feel like we can all reflect in our lifestyle and distinguish what changes we can make with our lives to help maintain our planet.

I agree in that, while reading the different approaches to reigning in the climate crisis, the one that stood out to me was educating girls and family planning. This is not only a climate issue, it is a human rights one. The fact that girls are denied basic healthcare and contraceptives is horrible. The climate crisis is so entertwined with issues surrounding human rights, discrimination, and politics, that there is no way to separate these issues. I believe places like the United States have the power to influence other countries to support these causes and pass legislation supporting women and girls. We just need politicians and leaders that care about these issues and are willing to push for them. We also need people to stand up and speak out for change. We can make a difference by changing our diets and our habits, but we can also speak out for other people and show our support for these women and girls.


<br><hr>
I agree with you. I can’t believe that we have already been in week 6. As an environmental studies major student, I have learned a lot of environmental things before and also met a lot of teachers who have a passion for the whole environment. But all of them are just teaching me the consequence of some changed or some movements. I have to learn all of them with a sorry mind and to just confront the consequence of any environmental crisis and have nothing to do to help with it. 
                                    <br><br>
However, when I have Engl 23, with ken, I can learn from any cases and know what I can do to change the future’s negative consequence and help my offspring. Like in this passage, we can truly just learn from the lessons and let girls to have more rights to study. By doing this as the educational rates increased, there will just slow down the rate of increasing population. Gradually the limited resource that all of the people in the world wish for will be balanced.

<br><hr>
While I was reading Project Drawdown’s Solutions, I felt pretty optimistic as well. Even just reading the first 25 allowed me to see how tangible it is to save our planet. We’ve now expanded past ways that we can personally reduce our individual carbon footprints to what we can collectively do to combat climate change. The first solution was really surprising to me. I had never heard of HFCs or HCFCs and definitely did not know the difference. Placing regulations on refrigerant manufacturers would easily solve this problem, as well as creating nationwide campaigns to end their use. The impact that this would have is crazy to me because I never expected something like this to create such a great change. I also found the statistics presented in the family planning section interesting. In addition to what you mentioned about educating women about their ability to plan their pregnancies, we must provide birth control access to women in countries that don’t already have it, as well as provide the opportunity for education in order to promote the independence of women. This is not merely a solution to environmental issues but to societal issues too. 

                                    <br><br>

Another thing that stood out to me was that the combination of eating plant-rich diets and wasting less food would drastically improve climate conditions. Whenever Ken would mention that eating a more plant-rich diet would be a significant way we could all help the environment, I would feel pretty good about myself because I’m already a vegetarian. The statistics about food waste, however, made me realize that I can do so much more than just avoid meat. My family wastes a lot of food, which I realize can be prevented if we simply bought less food and bought only what we needed. Making this small adjustment can have a great impact.

I enjoyed this reading and felt that it was the most accessible to a large audience. I felt that the short article based format allowed a reader to get informed, while not facing the daunting task of reading something such as walden. For people who are not invested this is a perfect quick summary of simple ways to change every day habits or just simply becoming more conscious about the decisions they choose to make. 
                                    <br><br>
 The thing that stood out to me the most were the figures on food wastage. We have discussed food waste before in this class, but it really caught my eye due to the fact that I just recently read an article ( https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/study-reveals-food-waste-worse-than-thought ) on the fact that food waste could be 2x what estimates have been in the past (wealth being the most determining factor). Seeing that this is an older article I would want to see a updated figures on food waste.

Nick, I agree that the format of this particular reading is very inviting to a reader that is new to the topic of climate change solutions. As you put, this task is far less daunting than reading a whole novel such as Walden. By breaking down each solution, the reader gains a greater understanding of each solution individually. I feel that this is important because it does not overwhelm the reader, each individual solution seems doable and easy to incorporate into everyday lives. This more user-friendly format gives the reader information on each solution at their own pace. This is also powerful because the readers sees the impact of these changes in combination with one another. Like Ken notes in the video, by acting in specific sectors such as food production or educating young women and family planning, the impact becomes much greater while still appearing simpler. 
                                    <br><br>
Like many others have alluded to in their comments, I find it very surprising that Refrigerant Management is the number one ranked solution for carbon emission reduction. Especially when you consider that this goes hand in hand with the food sector. If you consider that reducing food waste and a plant-rich diet would also help with refrigerant management, you would see that the combined impact of these changes would be even larger. 
                                    <br><br>
For example, producing less food and consuming a more plant-based diet would create a reduced demand for food refrigeration. This would increase the impact of these changes even further than initially projected. Factoring in more effective agricultural practices such as regenerative agriculture or conservation agriculture, the food sector definitely has the most room for improvement and as Ken has stated, perhaps the most important.

The amount of food wasted around the world really surprised me. Ken mentions how 1/3 to 1/2 of all food is wasted and this is absurd but understanding why we throw away our food is mind-blowing. The kinds of food we throw away without hesitation is the real problem. Perfectly safe and nutritious food that does not fit appearance standards often gets overlooked and most of the times discarded. A company had a great idea to build their inventory around "ugly" foods that suppliers often throw out due to strange or undesirable characteristics. This idea helps to save valuable food from being thrown away and assists in shrinking one portion in our food waste issue. In the developed world, we often take food for granted because of our ease of access but food can be a difficult resource to find in some areas of the world and we shouldn't take our blessings for granted.

I also really enjoyed the reading. At first, I thought "25?? That's a lot of stuff to read." However, it was not much, only a few paragraphs per idea. I think this simplistic approach was a very smart way of formatting the knowledge that can be spread to others. I also really enjoyed reading about the possible solutions that we can work towards to make our world cleaner. The reading this week was certainly less dreary than the readings from the first few weeks.

                                    <br><br>

The article on food waste also stood out to me. I volunteered at a food bank in my hometown on a number of occasions, and one of the jobs we had to do was sort through all of the food that the big grocery stores had rejected so that it could be sold to lower-income individuals. A lot of the fruit looked fine - maybe a little bit of scarring on the skin of an orange - but other than that, edible. The people that worked at the food bank told us that many grocery stores find these fruits to be unsellable because they looked damaged or unsightly, when in fact the purpose of the skin is to protect the fruit. Therefore, if the skin has scarring, it's doing its job. The article about food waste mentioned something similar, how "ugly" fruit would not be sold and instead wasted. I hope that the waste of food has gone down and that places like the food bank - that redistribute the "grocery-store-unworthy" food - become more prevalent in the future.

I think Ken made a very good point. it is necessary to forsee the future. but i do not agree we should travel less. travleling boosts the economic growth. if we fly less, the airports, airline companys, aircraft companys will have to face a big deal of financial loss, thus increase the number of unemployment. Also, taking airplanes are also a way to save time. Some people, such as people who work in modeling company, need to work in several different countries, it is impossible for them to fly less; otherwise they lose their job. For climate vanguard, I dont think this position is necessary. in free countries like US, people do not hold much respect for this position since they dont like to be told what to do. we should tell the public of future plan and explain how to approach, instead of setting restriction to public. it is always a better way to solve problem from an education point and public awareness.

I think we should use airplanes only if you are flying out of the country. Countries like the US should look into making high speed trails all over the country. You can say it is like the highway system created back in the 1950s. If we do a high speed trail system, I am sure it would lower unemployment and may even faster. It can also be very fun seeing the different views as you go from San Francisco to New York by train.

Honestly, I’m not surprised that switching a lightbulb didn’t make it to the top twenty-five. Same for electric cars. Even before taking this class, I wouldn’t have ranked electric cars in the top twenty-five. Then again, I wouldn’t have been able to list twenty-five significant solutions anyway. On the other hand, I am very surprised at the highest-ranked solution. I would have never thought Refrigerant Management would be number one. Fixing the ozone layer has been praised as a great accomplishment, but it’s kind of ironic that HFCs have come back to bite us. It makes me wonder if the substitutes, “such as propane and ammonium,” will have some indirect negative effect on the environment or people. 
                                    <br><br>
If someone had asked me to guess the highest-ranked solution, I would have said controlling the population, such as through numbers six and seven, educating girls and family planning. Logically, reducing the number of people on the planet would lighten the load on resources. Yet, solutions targeting overpopulation aren’t even in the top three. I was shocked when Ken said that, “there are roughly 25 million unplanned pregnancies every year.” I personally don’t know a single person who has had an unplanned pregnancy. I know that in developing countries women often have many children, probably unplanned, but 25 million is just a lot.

                                     <br><br>


To me, numbers become gibberish if you give me too many. If they aren’t extreme, then they won’t be very striking or memorable. 25 million astounds me because of how immense that number is, so large I can’t imagine 25 million of anything. When I read the IMPACT sections of the reading, however, they all started blurring together. I’d like to know more about what 25 gigatons of carbon dioxide means qualitatively. It sounds like a lot, but to the average person, it just sounds like a lot. Also, once you see billion and trillion thrown around like they’re nothing, it reduces the impact of the actual number. I recognize that these solutions are extremely significant due to how big the numbers are, but that’s all I can see because it’s too abstract for me to grasp easily. It’s great that the ranking really helps me understand how these solutions stand relative to each other.  
                                    <br><br>



I’m glad that we’ve finally started to look at a variety of solutions. The list is very informative, and it included solutions that I had forgotten, didn’t know, and had more or less importance than I thought they had. I learned about geothermal energy in middle school, but I didn’t realize it’d be a significant energy source, since it has been understandably overshadowed by wind and solar, that could let “39 countries… supply 100% of their energy.” 100% is a really significant percentage. Another number I found shocking enough to instantly remember was the decrease in cost for photovoltaics from “$1,900 per watt” in 1954 to “sixty-five cents per watt today.” Rooftop solar can also drop from “$1,883 per kilowatt… to $627 per kilowatt by 2050.” Although advances in technology aren’t capable of solving the root issues of climate change, I am heartened by how they still can help. Also, I can’t believe I forgot that solar thermal electricity/concentrated solar power (CSP) existed. It was overshadowed by photovoltaics, but has potential. Also, I didn’t know afforestation was a thing, and I also forgot that peatlands are important. I was also surprised that they were “second only to oceans in the amount of carbon they store,” since I never bothered thinking about what the second-best was. After being reminded that peatlands exist and are important, I was relieved to see that most of the world’s peatlands are still intact, and that restoring them is still possible.

I definitely agree with you that I never thought such simple things as switching to a different type of lightbulb or unplugging your phone charger would make a big difference. The same goes with electric cars. I guess the reason we hear about those things more often is because they are actions that we can take as an "average" human being. Most of us do not really have the opportunity to make changes regarding wind turbines, silvopasture, or peatlands. I was very pleasantly surprised to find out, though, that changing one's diet, reducing food waste, and reconsidering how many children we want are very high on the list of the most important solutions for climate change. Those are definitely things that we can change as individuals and I think it is important for us to realize that we do actually can make a huge difference in our everyday lives. Of course, I knew that switching to a plant-based diet is important if we want to reduce global warming but - like many people - I thought that I don't have much power as an average person. Often it seems like so many of our problems are caused and controlled by big corporations who only care about profit, or multimillionaires who are too selfish to use all their money for making a change, when, in fact, some of the most essential solutions to the climate crisis apply to people like you and me.

                                    <br><br>

I also agree with what you said about hearing so many huge numbers. It is difficult to wrap your head around what they actually mean since we can barely even comprehend what a million - or a billion - really is. That's why I prefer it when Ken gives us real-life examples that help us visualize some of those abstract numbers. For instance, when he mentioned in this video that the energy we save by unplugging our chargers for one day is used up in one second of driving a car, I was honestly very surprised. As I said, I highly doubted that such a minor action would actually make a difference, but learning about the relation to driving was really interesting. I hope we hear more examples and explanations like this because it really helps to put things into perspective and it is definitely easier to remember than some huge number that I have no real connection to.



<br><hr>

I agree with you that it is almost impossible to fully comprehend how much x million tons of carbon dioxide really is. I think Project Drawdown could break down these monumental numbers by making comparisons to things we are actually more familiar with (i.e. one gigaton of carbon dioxide emissions equals x miles driven in a car). Since most of the numbers mentioned in Project Drawdown are massive, these quantities begin to have less of an effect for readers because of the redundancy of them. Supplementing the greenhouse gas emission statistics that deforestation accounts for with images of huge areas of burnt land I think would give the audience a better picture of the detrimental effects of certain greenhouse gas emitters.  

                                    <br><br>

This summary also opened my eyes to other changes that could be made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly. Since the list included both personal and large-scale solutions to the climate crisis, it gave me better insight into which widescale initiatives would really help the reduction of carbon emissions, like refrigerant management and educating girls. This reinforced the idea that in order to successfully combat climate change, we need to implement smart, personal environmental choices while also collectively supporting policies that favor drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions.



<br><hr>
I agree, and I am happy you went into this thinking that that would not be on the list. I am surprised when I hear people think that things like that would actually make an impact, but I guess they have been led to believe, falsely, so. I personally have owned this book for a little while now and I have found it to echo much of what I have personally thought to be our greatest environmental issues: land use, food production, women’s empowerment, and renewable electric generation. I think it is tremendously important that people understand the impacts of what they do, however I find it sad that people don’t comprehend the magnitude of the important and meaningful decisions they make and that they are forced into by governments and corporations.

I think this list of solutions is very important and should be shown to everyone. If only people knew small changes like changing your diet slightly or wasting less food that the world would be way better for it. The most surprising for me though had to be number 1 as I would have never thought managing refrigerant would not have that big of impact on the environment. It's something that I never think of, and yet just managing it better would have the largest impact on the environment. Although it’s a very good thing because it is very easy to change the way you use your AC and refrigerator. When I went home for winter break I told my parents that we had a big carbon footprint, which we do, but my mom assured me that she uses AC very little so that our impact is less, and I didn’t think that was a big deal. Apparently I was quite wrong so I’m glad my mom was aware of this fact. A couple other solutions that surprised me were peatlands, which I did not know existed, nuclear which I thought would be worse for the environment, clean cookstoves which I would’ve never thought to be important to the environment, and educating women. I had never heard of peatlands before, yet they seem like really interesting environments that I would be interested in looking into. This environment is interesting since it takes in the second most amount of carbon behind the ocean, and therefore these places really need to be preserved. Nuclear would have never crossed my mind as being beneficial since it has many downsides, but I guess it produces less greenhouse emissions which is more important. Clean cookstoves is just strange because it's so specific and doubt anyone thinks about that, yet my mom actually watched a film on how bad they were and told me why which was quite interesting. Lastly educating women isn’t directly correlated to the environment and that is why it was strange. You wouldn’t think something that seems like a god given right in America would make such a huge change to the environment globally. But, if you think about it, it does make sense as women are more empathetic and also educating them gives them less of a chance of having children and reducing the population helps to save the planet. This list of solutions could be vital if it was shared with a lot of people as it could help inform them of changes they could make.

The contents of this list aren’t that surprising, but the rankings of the solutions are different than I expected. It's crazy to me that the number one solution is refrigerant management. That is something that I have honestly never thought about before. One of the saddest parts of this list is that many of these solutions either don’t cost any money to implement or create more savings than spendings. How is it that they don’t cost any money and or save us money, yet nobody is doing them. Many of these things people already know about, such as solar energy, plant-based diets, and rainforests. I was honestly a bit frustrated while reading this list. I feel almost helpless, how can we possibly get everyone to do these things that could have easily been already done? Its easier said than done, as most people simply just don’t care and don’t want to change their lifestyle for something larger than themselves. As Ken mentioned in the video, the top 25 solutions do more than the bottom 75 combined. None of the top 25 solutions are difficult, extremely time-consuming, or expensive. If we simply put a little effort into these solutions, it can make a huge difference. The refrigerant management is extremely easy to do, as all you have to do is recycle the liquid in your refrigerator, and it reduces 89.7 GT of carbon released into the atmosphere. I think if we start by reducing the easiest sources of carbon emissions, we can work our way up to the more difficult ones, instead of making huge changes all of a sudden. I think the only way for all of these solutions to be implemented is for the government to be 100% on board, which at this point seems impossible. For now, we have to reduce whatever emissions we can as individuals. Politics is all about pleasing the majority of the public, so if a majority of the public wants to reduce their carbon emissions, politicians will agree with that to get the most votes.

<p>
This all seems so smart and beneficial in so many ways it’s crazy to me that these solutions aren’t already being implemented and used more. Almost every single one of these techniques to mitigating climate change have very positive impacts on the environment while also being extremely economically efficient. It is interesting to me that the number one thing on the list is refrigerant management because a lot of the time people don’t directly make the connection between climate change and refrigerators and air conditioning. 
                                     <br><br>
Every single one of these techniques mitigates climate change while also being economically beneficial. If we combined multiple or all of these strategies, we could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a huge amount while also growing the economy. A lot of times people don’t believe that sustainability and economic growth can go hand in hand, but this reading has shown that it is actually very possible and that we really can have both. I found it amazing that only 32 offshore wind turbines are capable of supplying all 466,000 habitants of Liverpool, England. If more countries developed this form of energy, a lot of money could be saved and emissions could go down by a lot. 
                                    <br><br>
 The category of food production and land use is a big one in the top 25 things. Cutting out meat is not very hard to do. If you start with just cutting it out once a week and work your way to eating a largely plant based diet, it eventually becomes natural and you don’t even care that you don’t eat meat. Eating plant-based can also be a lot more fun, colorful and healthy if you do it the right way. Just a simple change in your own individual diet can be extremely beneficial both to yourself and to the planet. 
                                    <br><br>
 I hope to see these things become more of a reality in the upcoming years. They have to or else we will be unable to reverse the damage. However, in order for these things to be acted upon, there must be change in our government leaders, which we can do! This upcoming election will help have a lot of say in determining the fate of our planet and what is in store for the future inhabitants of it. This reading was very encouraging and motivating because it showed that it is very possible to combat this crisis.

Food production and land use are very large contributors to our carbon footprint. I also believe that they are some of the easiest habits to change. As you said on the topic of meat if a person were to just slowly work their way up to a fully plant-based diet they eventually will not feel the urge or need to eat meat anymore. Even more so your body begins to adapt to your diet and eating meat won't make you feel as good as a plant based diet would. 
                                    <br><br>
Another big contributor was the energy sector. When it comes to the topic of energy I always wonder what the world would look like if back in the 70s and 80s we had moved to a primarily nuclear based energy sector, as when nuclear energy is done right it is clean and efficient. Although there is a debate on the efficiency of nuclear energy. I understand the potential issues that have to be weighed in regards to nuclear energy. Today, however, I don't think a turn toward nuclear would be a good call and what is happening reflects this as many nuclear power plants are shutting down. If we turn towards renewable energy in the form of wind, solar, and hydro we could reduce our footprint that comes from oil and natural gas. I think a great way to achieve this would be to take government funding and subsidize wind and solar to make it appeasing for energy producers to change their product. I think the government has a role in helping change climate change but unfortunately everything in politics takes forever. For that reason I believe individual choices as consumers will make the most impact on whether or not we will be able to save the world in time.


<br><hr>
I agree I think the list is really useful and more awareness needs to be brought to the list. I also was surprised by the first item on the list and did not really know much about the issue. Reading the list made me feel hopeful as there are many ways that we can do our part to help the planet. As I previously stated in another comment I think meat consumption is an issue that we can attempt to undertake. I know a few people that have implemented a vegan/vegetarian diet and feel healthier. I think we also need to make this form of living more accessible to people and provide easy options for people to cook. While it is easy to say we should all partake in it we also have to understand that some people do not know the benefits to a vegan diet or do not have markets with fresh greens and fruits. Where I live the market does not have fresh fruits or greens and it is difficult to by affordable products. If I wanted organic food I would have to go to a Whole Foods and a lot more money would be spent there than at the local market. While I do enjoy eating organic and healthy vegetarian meals it difficult to access. So I think by making these food options more accessible all around would be most beneficial.

 I agree with your opinion. This time’s reading is a bit different from what we’ve been assigned before. Rather than telling us the truths about the climate crisis, Project Drawdown is like a manual for both the society and the individuals on how to act and save the planet compatibly. The solutions on the webpage are aligned in a pattern in accordance with their relative reduction on CO2 emission. And it is this pattern that made me feel surprised. I just cannot believe the most urgent things we should tackle are refrigerant management, wind turbines, and food waste! Furthermore, several things that made me awe are those that I felt extremely remote to climate topic, like peatlands and nuclear. At the time specifically after watching Cowspiracy, I am now paying more attention to the agriculture, and not pissing me off, this webpage includes nearly 10 effective solutions about addressing agricultural issues or land use and deforestation. Instead of being regarded as a call-for-action, this article means more. It teaches me numerous facts and tens of new information that I don’t know have relations to our class.
<br><hr>

I agree with you on the fact that there are solutions being put in our hands but we just haven’t done anything to put them into practice. You are very right. Every solution listed in the reading will benefit the United States and essentially every part of the world economically. If people are worried about the potential collapse our economic market, it makes no sense how they think not investing in renewables or better food sustainability techniques to reduce our overall carbon footprints but it’s easy to invest in starting your own business. To me, I see a simple choice between the two types of investment. But sadly, people dont care enough to do make the choice to put these solutions into practice knowing that this is a growing issue. 
                                    <br><br>

I noticed that food production really stood out among all the solutions as you pointed out. I agree with you, meat is not a hard thing to cut out of your diet. During week one, horrified about the effect meat has on climate change, I made the choice to cut off red meat completely. It’s now week six and I’ve been making better choices on the food I do buy and moving towards vegetarianism. While plant based is the ultimate goal, it’s little things like self awareness that will make all the difference. But many people around the world are as strong minded as this. They are so unwilling to give up the luxuries that we are so accustomed to living on that we’ve taken things like food for granted. People aren’t realizing that climate change isn’t just because of our industrial side effects, agriculture and the way we treat food is just as equal which is what is helpful about the reading towards proving solutions. So while I am a little pessimistic towards the global solutions that we need to make as Ken mentions, I do see some hope in smaller groups or at the personal level making cultural change because after all, it does start in the household when fostering the younger generation.

I completely agree with you on the level of approach that has become most appropriate in making real change occur, especially after reading “Summary of Solutions.” Political routes in creating viable change can take much too long for an issue on a clock, so we may have to think about creating change on a much more personal level. The solution about meat consumption that you’re speaking about is one of the simplest issues to be undertaken at the personal level. Just like you described, switching to a plant based diet may not be enjoyable, convenient, or affordable for some but it may actually be easier than you think. Although I still do consume meat, I have lowered the amount I consume considerably within the past year. Going from eating meat in some form at least once or twice a day at home, I have made the switch to consuming small amounts of meat maybe only twice or three times a week. I’m happy that lowering my intake of meat may reduce my carbon footprint, but honestly the reason I’ve changed my habits is because of the animals being killed for consumption. Either way, I have discovered something that I previously thought was impossible is actually very doable. Since changing my diet, my grocery bills have actually gone down because although I’m buying more, I’m not spending money on expensive meats. I’ve also noticed a small yet better change in physique and in overall feelings of health. Eating more but better has improved my lifestyle and carbon footprint, which really inspires me to go further with it. Personally, I’d recommend everyone try this type of diet because it is the simplest change you can make in bettering your own health and that of the planet.
<br><hr>

I agree with you especially with the point that “sustainability and economic growth can go hand in hand”. In a lot of cases, the reason why people refuse to turn to sustainability or do not act immediately to reduce the carbon footprint is that they believe it will slow or even reverse economic growth. It also becomes a formal excuse for many businesses and industries. However, in Project Drawdown, it made clear that we can cut greenhouse gas emissions and improve our economic growth in the meantime. Furthermore, regarding changing into a plant-based diet, I agree that it is partially a change in the habit. Changing one’s habit is challenging, but not impossible. It will be hard in the beginning. You may need to be reminded or want to give up. But when you go through a difficult time, it will become easy and natural.
                                    <br><br>
In general, for a reader who wants to find ways to mitigate global warming, this document provides perfect and enough information and solutions. However, for a student who needs to remember these things to get prepared for the final, it suddenly becomes not so good (just kidding). Among these top 25 solutions, from refrigerant management to concentrated solar, food and land use play a huge part. By combining solution #3 and #4, which are reduced food waste and plant-rich diet, we can reduce the CO2 emission by roughly 137 gigatons. Moreover, it is surprising to know that by improving girls education and family planning, we can cut 103 gigatons of GHG. Last but not least, each solution listed on the project can cause a financial benefit. All in all, this document gives us the right direction. And I hope these words will not be “squashed knowledge”. After reading all these solutions, we need to use them in our practice, instead of forgetting them in the next second.



<br><hr>

I concur with you. I had no idea refrigerator emissions can total to 25 to 79 gigatons of carbon dioxide. I do not think people are aware of the diversity of climate drivers. What was truly compelling to me was the efforts Kenya is making to offer education to 80 percent of its boys and girls. The list brings awareness to the things we can do to reduce our carbon footprint. However, I think our best bet is to educate the youth and teach them in school about climate change. It is of paramount importance to start providing more education to more girls. 
                                    <br><br>
According to the Drawdown Project, " Women with more years of education have fewer and healthier children, and actively manage their reproductive health." If we are able to curb the world's population; ultimately, we have fewer people who will do harm to Earth. 51.48 gigatons of emissions can be reduced by 2050 if we are able to offer universal education to everybody. Besides the impact on the population, universal education would present an opportunity for social and political mobility, Contrary to our current political leaders, I think if we are able to have more college graduates, we will have a greater capacity to do something about climate change.



<br><hr>

I totally agree with all that was said in your comment and I am also happy that we are being given a guideline backed with research to be able to combat the climate crisis. I feel like the plant-based diet is the most concerning to me. As a college student, I am doing my best to limit my meat intake but I find it hard to see how it's making a difference. Eating in the dining commons means that there is food already prepared for you and that there are limited choices on what you can eat. When food is already bought and prepared for places like a college dining commons, I wonder if not choosing to eat the meat that is already prepared is even making a difference. Don't get me wrong, I understand how important limiting meat in our diets is not only for the planet but for our own health as well, but I just wonder how it could still make a difference. As much as I support plant-based diets, I can't help but think about how many people will lose their jobs. In my home town, driving down the street means seeing cows grazing on open fields, I would hope that these practices are sustainable enough for those farmers to keep their jobs. However, I absolutely do not support the cruel treatment of animals for some unhealthy meat with a bunch of hormones and I am sure I will hate it more once I watch "Cowspiracy". I hope reports like this give people and our government motivation to change our ways before it's too late, based on the many statistics from research, it seems like the world is going to end in 2050. I refuse to die at the age of 49 for something that has been researched and given solutions. America needs to change now. We all keep saying it and thinking about it, but when will it actually happen?



<br><hr>
I agree with what you said about making plant-based food products more affordable and accessible in grocery stores and restaurants. A lot of restaurants claim to have vegetarian or vegan options when really they have one plate of pasta with marinara sauce while the rest of the menu is primarily meat based. Personally, I think that vegan and vegetarian food genuinely tastes better and makes you feel better. There are so many restaurants that do a very good job at having a variety of plant-based options and I think that making that a reality for most restaurants is really important. When people are given the option of a tasty vegetarian dish, they have more of a chance of choosing that than if they weren't even given the choice.

In all honesty, the most surprising thing about this list is the fact that refrigerants are on top of it. I never realized that they produced so much carbon emissions. According to the readings, refrigerants are harmful to the ozone during the production process and at the “end of life disposal.” Apparently, CFCs and HFCs are extremely harmful to the environment, the former being significantly worse. The solution they presented to this was to ensure that refrigerants are contained, particularly after they have been disposed of. Doing so could contain 89.7 gigatons of CO2, and this, along with the process of phasing out HFCs, could cost $903 billion.

This brings me to why I enjoyed this reading so much. Every single section delves into the implications and benefits of implementing each solution or failing to. On top of that, they have a cost breakdown that puts into perspective just how big a change each solution is. According to Ken, it is “the most comprehensive plan” available to combat climate change, and it’s not difficult at all to believe that. Each solution is practical and is backed by evidence to support their claim.

My favorite solution that I never even knew existed in this reading would have to be silvopasture. This method requires one to plant trees on pastures to not only offset the CO2 emissions from livestock but also improves the health of the land and the animals. I never knew a method like this existed but when I think about it, it makes so much sense. Trees provide the ground nutrients just as much as the ground provides it nutrients. Employing this method, on top of everything I mentioned above, could also drastically cut down on deforestation because there wouldn’t be a constant need for new land for cattle to graze on. On top of that, it makes the land more productive which in turn saves farmers/livestock producers money.

I agree with your comment. When I looked at these rankings, I was shocked that refrigerant management is in the first place. HFCS, the main alternative to CFCs and HCFCs, keeps the ozone layer from destroying, but they are 1,000 to 9,000 times more capable of warming the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. It costs a lot of money and scientists are still working on it. Although we cannot entirely depend on technologies to solve environmental problems, we can improve our behaviors to save the world. Just like you mentioned the silvopasture, I think it is a good way to reduce pollution and greenhouse gases. Silvopasture can provide additional revenue. For livestock herders, increasing long-term timber while maintaining forage yields provides more income than grazing alone. In some areas, pine straw harvesting can also provide additional income. Both forage fertilization and animal manure help improve soil and tree nutrition. Grazing can control competing for shrub species and reduce fire risk. Trees create a sheltered microclimate to protect animals from heat and cold. Shade also improves feed quality and prolongs the growing season. The pruning of some trees, such as poplars, can also be used as fodder. The result is better livestock growth. By creating a more diverse ecosystem, wildlife habitats can also be created.

This is by far the most interesting and easy reading we have in this class and I enjoy reading it a lot. I found it it is a very simple but effective reading and I like how it is being separated into a lot different categories and ways about what are the methods we can do to reduce carbon emission. Some of the methods such as about the reusable(wind,solar) energy, family planning are some things I have beard about before so I am not too surprised when I read this. But there are a few aspects that are new to me and opened my mind a lot and I do see how they can be some effective way to reduce climate crisis. For example, the one about how we can improve rice cultivation but at the same time can reduce carbon emission sound great. And I have never thought that there are actually types of rice that are differently water-loving and the use of nutrition on the rice differently can affect methane emission.
                                    <br><br>

Some ways are actually possible for people like us to change our daily lifestyles for example, if we choose to consume less products and waste less food, I believe it would help with making less greenhouse gases emission, also I know not everyone are vegetarian and it night be hard for people to not eat meat, however, there are ways on the type of meat we choose to consume .e.g less beef will produce less methane and the ways on raising cattle and plant crop would also bring huge changes and climate crisis.
                                    <br><br>

I like how this reading helps me understand the different problems might causing climate crisis and it provide significantly effective ways on how we can make changes on those aspects.

I agree with Wahyan Tam. The reading Project Drawdown is much simpler, clearer, more attractive and more interesting than before reading. It provides some useful methods that teach us how to decrease our personal carbon emission effectively. Some methods are often seen before, like driving electric cars, using the refrigerators without HFC. Some problems are heard by the first time, such as our cooking stove also harmed our planet seriously. For me, I think the most attainable solution is to decrease the waste of food. I cannot imagine human reach a tremendous number of wastes of food.
                                    <br><br>
Moreover, connect to the film Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret or Wasted, we may not be able to completely avoid meat or beef, but we can improve our eating habits without wasting food. We eat more chicken than we eat more beef, which reduces the harmful gases emitted by eating a lot of beef.

I completely agree with what you said in regards to this week’s reading. I also appreciate how simple and straightforward the reading was. The manner in which it was written makes it easy to understand all the different ways we can reduce our carbon footprint. The reading was also effective in putting into perspective how much we can decrease our greenhouse gas emissions and how each change will impact the environment. I like how each topic had an impact statement because it helps me understand just how much we are reducing our emissions and how much we can save as a result of this change. Not only did it make it simple to understand, by putting a number on the impact we will have, it motivates me to make changes in my lifestyle. In my opinion, just hearing that by doing so and so, you can help the environment, is not an effective way of bringing about change. After all, you can’t see the impacts of the changes you make, so it is important to quantify the results. That way, we know that the changes we make will actually do something.
                                    <br><br>


Like you’ve mentioned before, some of the changes we can make to reduce emissions was not surprising nor new to me. For example, reducing food waste, eating a plant-rich diet, educating young women, using renewable energy such as wind, solar, and nuclear, and using clean cookstoves were all things I’m sure everyone has heard of before. However, there are some that are new to me. Improved rice cultivation was the one that stood out to me the most. I have never stopped to think that by flooding rice paddies, it provides the perfect anaerobic environment for microbial organisms to create methane. It was interesting to learn how by changing the way rice is grown and type of rice grown, 11.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced. Additionally, farmers could realize $519 billion in additional profits. These figures were definitely mind-boggling to me that such a small change could have this big of an impact.

                                    <br><br>

After reading the various ways we can reduce our carbon emissions, it gives me some hope that not everything is doomed. If everyone were to follow and adhere to even a few of these solutions, we can make a tremendous amount of change and cut back our emissions.

If we are to change the path in which the climate crisis is headed, we must change our lifestyles. We may begin to change by switching to a plant-based diet. I am not a vegan by no means because I do eat chicken from time-to-time thus I don't consider myself a vegan by definition; however, I have cut red meat from my diet, completely. Although I am not a vegan, I have taken a small step in the right direction by becoming more conscious of what I consume for nutrition meant. I believe that in order to change our social culture we must take small steps to achieve our end goal and while doing so keeping in mind the reason for why we are doing this, to begin with. This kind of mindset will remind us that we are attempting to help minimize the effects of the climate crisis globally. Therefore, when society does decide to switch to a plant-based diet people understand that the meat industry is very cruel and inhuman for the way the animals are treated. Cows, for example, are strapped into some sort of milking machine. I have heard of instances where the machine starts pulling too much on the cow’s teats to extract all the milk possible causing the cow to bleed. We all know about the means in which cows are raised, fed chemicals to make them large in a short period of time so that the farmer has more meat to sell. These methods essentially exploit the indefensive cows who serve no other purpose but to satisfy the demands of the population. For this ever-growing demand, farmers are trying to increase their production in order to satisfy their clients. If we (as a united society) decide to move to a plant-based diet there would be no more need for farmers to raise and slaughter livestock, as a result of fewer methane emissions into our atmosphere. 
                                    <br><br>
Although the climate crisis primarily relies on cultural change, other methods aimed to address the increasing global warming crisis are technological advancements and reengineering old methods. One of the methods that I found intriguing was regenerative agriculture. Due to a large amount of food needed to feed cows the large portion of the agriculture industry is to grow cow food. The large need for these crops, unfortunately, leads farmers to overwork the land until it becomes unusable. Therefore the new approach is regenerative agriculture which aims to renourish the soil with carbon by not using fertilizers, grow different crops and rotate where crops are grown in order to allow the soil to regain what it needs to become usable again.

“Project Drawdown” highlights the diverse and many ways we can curb the climate crisis. For example, I never would have expected that refrigerant management needs to be fixed in so many ways. “The operational costs of refrigerant leak avoidance and destruction are high, resulting in a projected net cost of $903 billion by 2050,” “Project Drawdown” notes; additionally, HFC’s “have 1,000 to 9,000 times greater capacity to warm the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.” Ken notes that “eliminating the use of hydrofluorocarbons” is the number one solution. This needs to be publicized more! Overall, Ken hits one point home. The answer to the climate crisis is not in technology. It is changing our current lifestyle, such as wasting less food and eating a plant based diet. 
                                    <br><br>

Reducing food waste is number three on the list of importance. It is crazy to me that reducing food waste can have ten times the impact of switching to LED lightbulbs. If I had a dime for everytime I heard about switching lightbulbs to ‘save the environment,’ I would be rich. 
                                    <br><br>
I was shocked to see that crooked carrots are thrown away. It just seems so pointless, because regardless of the shape the carrot will still taste the same, and the producers are just wasting money. It is very important for people to know that plant rich diets would reduce 66 gigatons of emissions, making it very impactful and important. Also, we desperately need to get the birth rate down. We will use up all of our resources on earth if we keep carrying on like this, with massive population growth.
                                    <br><br>

Overall, I believe that “Project Drawdown” is imperative for the masses to be aware of. I believe that we should make some sort of campaign to try and get this list out to everyone, so everyone can start changing their lifestyles for the better, and be environmentally conscious. This is the perfect “roadmap,” as Ken states, to helping our environment with precise steps we need to take.

When reading through the list, there were so many things on there that I had never expected to be that harmful to the environment in the way that most of us recognize the fossil fuel and beef industries as large carbon emitters. I didn't realize the refrigerant industry, something that each of us/our families have all connected with in terms of owning refrigerators in our homes- had such an impact on carbon emissions. But like you and Ken both said, the most important factors we need to be reevaluating is not technology, but our own lifestyles. It is how we eat, consume, and even think that has a real impact on the climate crisis. We can tell ourselves that swapping plastic for metal straws is really going to save us from the climate crisis, but what will that matter when our drink is made out of dairy and other ingredients that are harvested in ways harmful to the land. We can tell ourselves that not leaving our chargers plugged in when we are not using them will help prevent the energy waste at home, but what does that matter if you live in a 2000 square foot home.  People will complain about the massive population growth, but bar women and girls from getting an education and having access to reproductive health and an overall choice over what to do with their bodies. 
                                    <br><br>
The solutions that Project Drawdown provides are very insightful and should be circulated to the public even more because it shows people what the biggest problems we as humans contribute to the climate crisis- our habits and lifestyles. Maybe then will people reevaluate their actions and strive to make a bigger more impactful change.

I was also super surprised by the fact that refrigerators cause so much damage to the environment- that they actually contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer once they lose its function- and I agree that it should be publicized more. In general, I think this entire list should be read by everyone across the globe; it’s the answer that I, and I’m sure many others, have been searching for since the beginning of this class. Learning how much global gas emissions can be reduced through all the suggestions- investing in silvopasture, regenerative agriculture, temperate forest restoration- finally gave me a sliver of hope for our planet. At the same time, many of the top 25 approaches were impossible to achieve on a personal level or impractical for a college student like me to participate in, especially the ones regarding land use and investing in different types of energy. However, they seemed very realistic in terms of being achieved, whereas other tactics such as reducing flying and car use seems unlikely to happen anytime soon.
                                    <br><br>
I was also very interested by the exact information provided about the amounts of carbon dioxide and money that was saved from each approach. I wonder how they were able to calculate these values in order to project the specific amounts for the future and how accurate these findings are.




<br><hr>
I had a very similar reaction to you while reading about all of these solutions in the sense that I was so surprised that certain solutions I had never heard of (like refrigerant management) were at the top of the list, while things that are constantly preached to us as "earth savers" (shorter showers, changing light bulbs, etc.) didn't even appear in the top 25! Having taken English 22 last quarter, I thought I had a good amount of knowledge about what we can do to curb our carbon emissions, but this reading really showed me that I have so much more to learn and have only scratched the surface as far as environmental solutions go. This list is so informative and packed with statistics and I think it would be so helpful if more people read it and actually understand what needs to be done in order t reduce our CO2 emissions, instead of being fed "sustainable solutions" like electric cars by companies that really don't have the planet's best interest in mind.
                                    <br><br>
I was also really shocked to read that carrots are legit just thrown away for being crooked and not looking "perfect". A carrot is a carrot, food is food. As long as it is safe to eat (which a crooked carrot is) who cares what it looks like?! There are people who don't have the privilege of eating just 2 whole meals a day, let alone choosing the most handsome looking produce. The mentality that people in the U.S. have towards food needs to undergo a drastic makeover, not only about the way our food looks but about how much of it we are wasting each and every day while other people starve to death.



<br><hr>
I agree with you that I also would have never expected refrigerant management to be such a big issue. The fact that HFCs have 1,000 to 9,000 times greater capacity to warm the atmosphere than carbon dioxide is so shocking to me. We absolutely need to start talking about this because this is the first time I have heard of it and I consider myself on the knowledgeable side of the climate crisis. 
                                    <br><br>

I was personally not shocked that reducing food waste can have 10 times the impact of switching to LED light bulbs because food waste is such a big problem. Like you said, if a carrot is even crooked, it is thrown away. I also remember when I was younger people would often talk about switching to LED light bulbs but I actually feel like, lately, people don’t talk about it. I agree that “Project Drawdown” is amazing and that it is imperative that more people find out about it. As students and young activists, many people look to us to spread awareness for these things so it is very important that we do. Thanks for your reply.

About 18 of these solutions are not things that can be achieved by the individual. Also, a lot of these solutions require big money and a lot of time. I think that this is one of the hardest parts of ES, because so many of the solutions dont have immediate effects. You could remove all the refrigerators right now, and you wouldn’t see the benefits for years. A lot of people are saying that this gives them hope that there are so many things to be done, but in truth, how willing is everyone to do their part? If you start making changes right now, how motivated will you be in 5 years when you don’t see any changes? Will you be able to maintain these changes for the sake of future generations? Also, the fact that refrigerators and air conditioners are at the top make sense since we import perishable food, keep perishables in stores 24/7, and have hot climates that people need to cool to survive in. How do you make the necessary changes to address those new problems?

After weeks of hearing from Ken and other sources about how bad the climate crisis was going to make things now and in the future, this article was a sliver of hope for us. As much as Ken has preached throughout the quarter about changing to a largely plant-based diet, that is just something I can't do. However, after reading this article I now know there are a lot of things that are just as or even more effective than changing my diet. 

                                    <br><br>

The solution that really sticks out to me is educating women. If we can educate women around the world, it would be very beneficial in many ways. First and more importantly, it would bring them opportunities in some regions that otherwise they would not have any. Secondly, there is a direct relationship between higher education from women and having less kids. It's simple math: less kids=less people=less consumption. If we can educate women in general, nonetheless educate them on climate crisis solutions, it will make a big difference. I hope there are more classes like this one that pop up in other places, because educating people on solutions who will then spread the word to even more people will be huge in terms of making a difference.

I agree with you, when I was reading these solutions I was also surprised about how high education and family planning were on the list (#6 and 7)! It's great to know that educating women and helping the climate crisis are intersectional issues, like knocking out two birds with one stone. I think most people realize family planning and education are important, but they do not know the degree to which it can impact someone's life, or even the planet. Although Ken has mentioned this topic in class, I was shocked at all the different ways it improves lives, like more productive agricultural plots, leading to better nourished families!

This reading made me hopeful for the future, and made me realize that change is actually possible, so long as we stick to a strict plan. SO many of these ideas seem valid, especially incorporating trees into grazing pastures to help sequester carbon dioxide into the ground, rather than release it directly to the atmosphere.

I think that educating women is one of the things that we have control over as well. WE can promote women being great around the world. Some people say that having a female president may be unattainable, but I think it could be one of the best things to happen in the world. Having a female in the presidency like Klobuchar or Warren could go a long way in teaching the young girls around the world that greatness is attainable if you work hard. The US President is the most well-known figure around the world, and if young people have someone like that to look up to, it would help a lot. I'm not saying we should just elect any female just because of their sex, neither am I saying that I agree with all of Klobuchar's and Warren's ideas, but I am saying that having a woman as president would have a great impact on the planet.

As a woman in America, I am interested in feminism, especially those of color. The readings that stood out to me and peaked my interest were the sixth and seventh articles. As an American, I am so ignorant about how privileged I am to just live here and be educated even through the public school system. I hate school and still hate it with a passion but I do it because everyone around me does and I need it for my future. I complain about everything and yet there are girls who yearn to be taught. I forget that I have this privilege until I read about the girls and women in third world countries who have the desire to be taught and be educated. Women such as Malala Yousafzai inspire me because they had to fight for something that I and mostly everyone in America have easy access to. It amazes me that educating women and teaching contraception can reduce the global carbon footprint by almost fifty two gigatons. 
                                    <br><br>

My school district did not teach sexual education and never once did we discuss the importance of contraception and women’s right to choice. If one single lecture about that topic can cause a reduction of the global carbon footprint, it should be mandatory.
                                    <br><br>

While reading article 7, the One Child Policy popped up in my head. I had learned about it and watched a documentary about it in my AP Environmental Studies class. China had a policy that restricted couples from having more than one child. Due to “maintaining” the family’s lineage, most people wanted boys than girls and often disowned any baby girls. This created an uneven ratio of men and women in the country where men overpopulated the women. Family planning, in my opinion, is so important as humans who create emotional and loving bonds with their children. I truly believe that educating women and even men about family planning can impact the world. Adoption should be widely considered for couples who want more children but have more than one biological child. I am reminded of one of Ken’s points from his previous lectures that a family should have one child per person (in most cases, two children).

To the surprise of no one, I was astounded the moment I opened the webpage that refrigerant was the number one issue facing climate change! Although we've already made one transition from CFCs to HFCs over concern for the ozone layer, we're still faced with the necessity of making yet another switch to propane or ammonium as per the Kagali Accord. Also of immediate surprise to me was the absence of electric vehicles, planes, and high-speed rail from the top 25 on the list; with so much emphasis on these topics this far on the course, I'd expected to have seen them at least to 20. Of similar surprise was the impact educating women would have on the climate, especially considering that it's the 6th and 7th on the list. 
                                    <br><br>

While surprising, these facts are something to rejoice since many of these things are possible through change in habits and not some miraculous feat of science to combat the crisis. Or is it? After all, this information was to reach upwards of 7 billion people amongst the miasma of disinformation and other issues of priority to many individuals. Additionally, systemic cultural change is perhaps one of the most inertial bodies in this push to a more green planet. 
                                    <br><br>

Many solutions listed I had never even heard of let alone considered. Food silvopasture wasn't something I'd ever been aware of, yet it is well above many of the other issues that are often seen by the public as most important for fighting climate change. 
                                    <br><br>

After reading these solutions and what has been done so far, for example the significant reduction in cost per watt for solar power, I have optimistic about the future and excited to explore a new, plant based diet!

Implementing the first 25 strategies alone would avoid the emission of 771.77 GIGATONS of CO2 into the atmosphere. The US emits approximately 5 gigatons of CO2 yearly, and the global average emission is approximately 32.5 gigatons of CO2 per year. Avoiding 772 gigatons of CO2 emissions would be equivalent to the US halting all carbon emissions for over 150 years, or the entire world emitting zero carbon for about 24 years. That is INSANE. While I am skeptical that these strategies will be put into effect to their full extent, I believe that they are all realistic enough to help immensely. 
                                    <br><br>
While I was familiar with the majority of these solutions, the main one also threw me off; refrigerant management. “Over thirty years, containing 87 percent of refrigerants likely to be released could avoid emissions equivalent to 89.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide.”I had no idea that chemical refrigerants were 1000x harmful to the environment than CO2. I read that CFC-13 (chlorotrifluoromethane, which is used for some industrial freezers) is over 16,000x more warming than CO2 over a 500-year period; not to mention, it has been thought to be linked to ozone depletion. CFC-13 has since been phased out (thanks to the Montreal protocol), but chemical refrigerants clearly still pose a huge threat. For example, “HFCs, the primary replacement [for CFC's], spare the ozone layer, but have 1,000 to 9,000 times greater capacity to warm the atmosphere than carbon dioxide."
                                    <br><br>
What’s ironic is that, as we emit more and more CO2 into the atmosphere and the earth gets warmer and warmer, refrigerant usage will also increase, leading to more emissions and further warming. This is a dead-end positive feedback loop, and only one of the many that we contribute to on a daily basis.  
                                    <br><br>
This reading shows that we HAVE all of the solutions we need; they are in our reach, and we are far too capable of implementing them to instead allow our world to crumble. We just need to get the ball rolling; the more that we shift our lives, the easier the following changes will be.

Ken said it best, each of these solutions can really be separated into individual actions and collective actions. I would like to comment on how many of these collective solutions are incredibly connected to our individual efforts. There are many instances where these draw down methods are intrinsically fueled by our individual decisions. For example our huge need for refrigeration is largely tied to food storage. If we were to adopt plant based diets and eat locally grown food we would immediately cut down our need for large scale cold storage of meat and produce. Our huge need for air conditioning is only exasperated by our use of fossil fuels to power our air conditioning. If we were to widely adopt heat pumps we could thus electrify our air conditioning and heating and greatly reduce carbon output when powered by renewable energy. If we are to change our transportation in combination with a change to the type of energy we put on the grid, we could significantly reduce the carbon foot print of transportation. I think it is really important for us to think about how some of these approaches can really be seen with the "killing two birds with one stone" or "Feeding two birds with one scone (vegan)" approach. I also think it's very important for people to understand these approaches because the simplicity of it is quite shocking. In theory all of these approaches are very manageable. it becomes difficult when you account for our different social identities, political ideologies, and governmental structures. We have many options, but as with most problems, we will have to start with the easiest first because we are generally pretty lazy people.

I really appreciated your comment because it made me realize how connected everything is. For me, knowing how connected things are makes it seem more daunting, because when you change one thing then something else has to change then something else and it’s a massive domino tower so precariously built that no one wants to touch it. But I liked your more positive (and vegan) approach: “feeding two birds with one scone.” If we as a society can thing of all of these solutions as interconnected, and see those ties as benefits rather than drawbacks, then I think we could really make changes.
                                    <br><br>

One thing that frustrated me when reading these solutions however, was how long everything takes. For example, the number one solution, refrigerants, was made in 2016, and the last bit of fade-outs won’t happen until 2028. That is so frustratingly long. I feel the same way about restaurants talking about phasing out plastic straws and utensils. I understand these big changes take a long time, but it makes the solutions a lot less hopeful for me.

I agree with you that the collective solutions are connected to our individual efforts. You said that, “...our huge need for refrigeration is largely tied to food storage”, which is true. And so, I completely agree with your idea that if we were to adopt a plant based diet and eat locally grown food, we would cut down our need for large scale cold storage greatly. Because most refrigerators primarily consist of meat, switching to a plant based diet would diminish that need for refrigeration, and in turn diminish the need of emitting so many greenhouse gases. I also agree with your idea of adopting heat pumps. So much of our emissions come from air conditioning, so why not just get the same effects from heat pumps, which are immensely cleaner?

Combining these approaches, as you said, “...can really be seen with the… ‘Feeding two birds with one scone (vegan)’ approach”, which I really liked. As you said, these approaches are shockingly simple, but because of the society we live in, it can be quite difficult for most to change. I agree with your last sentence about there being many options, and that with most problems, we tend to start with the easiest, because we’re lazy, but the sad thing is that we’re so lazy that we can’t even handle the easiest step. Maybe it’s because of the society we live in or that we actually are just lazy, either way it shouldn’t be able to stop us from making the simplest of changes in our lives to do what’s right for our planet.

Brendan, I really liked how you outlined the concept of individual action being connected to collective action. This is something I have tried to explain many times, but too often have fallen short. As the article pointed out, many environmentally conscious changes we could make in our agricultural practice also serve to mitigate its shortcomings. This trend is not one that is exclusive to agriculture but arises in almost all proposed changes. For example, switching from driving a car to relying on public transportation can cut significant costs at home. The trouble with this concept is, when it is explained, it is heard in the context of the current world. In other words, the individual action is removed from the context of the collective. To elaborate, not having a car in the current world is considered a major disadvantage and is thus, an unlikely change to make. However, in the context of a world where everyone switches to a more sustainable means of transportation, and excess funding is put into improving public transit, not owning a car becomes an advantage. The same can be said for a decrease in livestock and air conditioning. We have been creating problems with the solution in order to stick to the status quo for too long. We've run out of time for excuses, it is time for change.

One issue I had while reading these summaries that you actually helped touch upon, was that the information they presented seemed like such large scale data and made it hard to see how each one of us can contribute to make this impact. However when looking at each of the summaries, there are ways that each of us can individually help contribute. As consumers, we need to take back the market power in favor of the environment, so that all the large corporations exploiting our Earth for fossil fuels and for animal agriculture will have less of it. And the only way to do this is by correlating our demands to those that will benefit the planet. For example, if we continue to have a high demand for meat, deforestation and methane products will just continue to increase. The goals proposed in these summaries at first glance seem like they could be hard to accomplish, but really if we all took action to help do our part in these solutions we could make tremendous change. Just by reducing food waste, eating a plant based diet, and educating more girls globally would save us 103 gigatons of Co2 emissions. We have the knowledge and technology to make this all happen now, but the changes globally will not occur until every individual accepts their responsibility to contribute to these solutions. I think that we should prioritize the top 3 solutions (refrigerant management, wind turbines, and reduced food waste) because those contribute to more greenhouse gas emissions than the bottom 75 on the list combined. I also found it interesting to read the economic benefits we would receive from switching to clean energy and land restoration projects. The implementation costs for a lot of the solutions are in the billions, with net returns in the trillions. This information is really important to convince the government to focus on these sectors, because we know they highly prioritize profit. Overall I agree that all of these solutions stem from the individual and that by one person at a time we can manage to achieve these solutions.

I loved that you drew attention to what I thought was one of the most important takeaways from this video: that solutions are both individual and collective. We need to act individually but also support collective action. Like you mentioned, a change in our diets would have a positive domino effect on reducing carbon emissions because the need to constantly refrigerate meat would be eliminated. It’s crazy how much our diet affects carbon emissions. The livestock, the land, the production, the waste, the preservation all produce emissions. Therefore, I think changing our diets is the most clear place to start. I thought your “feeding two birds with one scone” was quite clever because it highlights how a vegetarian/vegan diet is not only good for ourselves and our personal health but also simultaneously helps the environment.

I was also so happy to finally reach a point in this class where we learn about more concrete steps we can take to combat climate change (yay!). It’s so nice to know that there are so many things we can do to reduce carbon emissions, possibly to a point where, as Ken mentioned, we can not only stop the climate crisis but reverse some of it. That being said, I was so surprised to read that some of the top solutions were to change chemical refrigerants, educate girls and reduce food waste, which I almost never hear about compared to switching to electric cars, efficient light bulbs etc. For me, this really highlighted the need to take action in reducing emissions but even more importantly, in spreading awareness of the climate crisis and educating people about appropriate, not faux , solutions to it.

Project Drawdown is a highly detailed plan on how to revert anthropogenic emission consequences. It incorporates a variety of methods and approaches to the climate change problem. From engineering advancements to female empowerment, this project encompasses nearly every possible solution we could take. I was surprised to see the impact education could have on climate crisis solutions. Education is a widely agreeable cause, so it confuses me as to why this fact isn’t more well known. I have to wonder, additionally, how this resource is taken compared to the multitudes of other environmental foundations. Drawdown appears to be nonpartisan and well thought out. I especially appreciate how both personal and collective approaches are addressed. In response to whether one approach is better than another, I believe that the little actions we make add up, much like the butterfly effect. Shifting your mindset to be more environmentally conscious leads to spreading that message to others, causing a direct reflection in aggregate supply in our economy as well as a move towards more sustainable legislation. Of course, sustainable actions of many individuals are not enough to combat our climate crisis, big businesses and world leaders who possess the money and power to create change are crucial if we hope to continue our time here on earth.

An interesting concept I recently learned about is the Master Gardeners of the Mayans. These ancient people learned to cultivate a variety of crops within the harsh terrain of their Mesoamerican landscape. Rather than slash and burn fields every year, they figured out how to grow plants together, forming an intertwined, complex system of botany, thus increasing productivity and soil quality while conserving space and water. This method has been reformed over centuries, passed down through the last Mayan ancestral line. I see the ideals of Master Gardeners in some of Project Drawdown’s solutions, which highlights the idea that the simplicity of ancient times are great solutions to our modern crisis.

I really liked the points you made here, such as how it is hard to say whether or not one approach is better than the other and that we essentially should be choosing as many, either personal or collective approaches, that work for us because at the end of the day every effort counts in a way. I also agreed with how education is such a significant causes and yet there is still a major lack of education on the topic; it is clear that it should be much more informed about. I liked the clarity of this reading assignment, simply informing us of choices and ideas that we can easily understand and apply to our lifestyles. Not instilling fear, not threatening or alarming, but rather giving us the facts and objectively displaying that doing "this" is what "that" would do--and it clearly shows that this is really what we SHOULD be doing. It gives me a sense of optimism in tackling this climate crisis, and making the solutions seem more approachable and attainable for hopefully many of us.

Thank you! I think we can both agree that an unbiased source for environmental sustainability is the most opportune way to educate our society and help them take part in combating our climate crisis.

I find it quite shocking that an individual can reduce their carbon footprint by so much by solely incorporating both #3 of Reducing our Food Waste and #4 by switching to a Plant Rich Diet. I was quite surprised that up to 35% of food is wasted by high income economies, and that lower income economies little to none is wasted. It got me thinking of the amount of food my family has wasted in the past because we often buy so many groceries, that often they go bad. Or when the milk is close to its best by date, I found myself throwing it away because I didn’t want to risk exposing myself to expired food. Or when my mother used to cook so much for our family, that whatever was leftover was put into tupperware containers and later placed in the back of the fridge for weeks untouched. And by the time the fridge was cleaned out, all those leftovers that were piled up were thrown away, the extra vegetables we had kept had now become susceptible to mold. I never noticed how wasteful my family was, until reading the solutions of Project Drawdown. I think that because my family is composed of 5 of us, my parents believed they had to purchase “extra” food for us solely to avoid another trip to the grocery store.

Another solution I have considered so many times is going vegan, I saw the many benefits to it and I found myself trying to go vegan for a week, but had failed by the third day when I noticed just how many of my favorite foods included dairy and eggs. And the temptations and social pressures when I was out with friends forced me to give in when we were at IN-n-Out. This week's reading encouraged me to try a plant-rich diet once again to see how it goes, and the incentive of  how much my carbon footprint can be reduced.

Hey Stephanie, I enjoyed reading your anecdote concerning your family's grocery shopping habits. The part that really hit close to home for me was your comment about how leftovers sit in the fridge for weeks untouched. After reading this weeks reading, I honestly can remember one too many times where my family bought food and then simply watched it go bad, which is not only a waste of money, but also a waste of ecological resources. The fact that one third of food raised doesn't even make it to the table does not need consumers like my family not finishing all the food we make as well. Ultimately, I think I will try and educate my family to plan more meticulous portion sizes so that less things go to waste. This week's reading also got me thinking about all the food waste from our school's dining commons. I can recall countless times where my friends and I would grab something, take one bite, and decide we didn't like an item of food. Although extremely wasteful, we would often justify it by the rational that the food gets "composted." I'm not really sure if there is any validity behind this statement or if composting is even beneficial on such a large scale level. I would be interested to hear what Ken has to say in regards to things such as composting being a viable outlet to get some benefit out of the mass waste of food in America because I'm not too sure about it's process. In the end, I agree that society has a lot of temptations when it comes to eating meat, because it is honestly a good tasting addition to many meals. As a global citizen, I think I also will try and reduce what I consume, especially beef.

I feel like everyone and every family have the habit of wasting food, even if it's completely unintentional. Despite living alone, I often find myself tossing out the spring mix I buy at Costco, as I never manage to finish the whole box without some of the greens going soggy and brown. I could also relate to you on the dilemma of switching to a more environmentally friendly diet, such as converting to veganism. Like you, my attempt lasted not too long before my family and friends indirectly told me how inconvenient my diet was. I honestly felt guilty, because often times my friends had to adjust to my needs and opt out on Korean BBQ to go to somewhere with a wider variety of dishes that I can also enjoy. After completing this week's reading, I feel much better knowing that the simple act of not wasting food is actually more impactful than completely changing my diet. It's interesting that in the case of fighting against climate change, it's in fact much more effective to simply not do something, such as wasting food and driving, than to do something, such as converting to veganism and switching to solar or wind energy.
